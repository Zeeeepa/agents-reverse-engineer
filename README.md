# AGENTS REVERSE ENGINEER (ARE)

**Reverse engineer your codebase into AI-friendly documentation.**

**Generate `.sum` files, `AGENTS.md`, and root docs for Claude Code, OpenCode, and any AI assistant that supports `AGENTS.md`.**

## Why This Exists

AI coding assistants are powerful, but they don't know your codebase. Every session starts fresh. You explain the same architecture, the same patterns, the same file locations — over and over.

**agents-reverse-engineer** fixes that. It generates documentation that AI assistants actually read:

- **`.sum` files** — Per-file summaries with purpose, exports, dependencies
- **`AGENTS.md`** — Per-directory overviews with file organization (standard format)
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — Project entry point for Claude Code
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** — System design overview for complex projects
- **`STACK.md`** — Technology stack from package.json

The result: Your AI assistant understands your codebase from the first message.

---

## Who This Is For

Developers using AI coding assistants (Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, or any tool supporting `AGENTS.md`) who want their assistant to actually understand their project structure — without manually writing documentation or repeating context every session.

---

## Getting Started

```bash
npx agents-reverse-engineer init --integration
```

This creates:

1. **Config** — `.agents-reverse-engineer/config.yaml`
2. **Commands** — `.claude/commands/are/` for Claude Code (other runtimes coming soon)

Then discover your files and create the plan:

```bash
npx are discover --plan
```

Finally, in your AI assistant:

```
/are:generate
```

The assistant reads the plan and generates all documentation.

> **Note:** The generated `AGENTS.md` files work with any AI assistant that supports this format. The `/are:*` commands currently target Claude Code, with OpenCode and Gemini CLI support planned.

### Staying Updated

```bash
npx agents-reverse-engineer@latest init --integration
```

---

## How It Works

### 1. Initialize

```bash
are init --integration
```

Creates configuration and Claude Code commands in your project.

---

### 2. Discover & Plan

```bash
are discover --plan
```

Scans your codebase (respecting `.gitignore`), detects file types, and creates `GENERATION-PLAN.md` with all files to analyze.

Uses **post-order traversal** — deepest directories first, so child documentation exists before parent directories are documented.

---

### 3. Generate (in your AI assistant)

```
/are:generate
```

Your AI assistant executes the plan:

1. **File Analysis** — Creates `.sum` file for each source file
2. **Directory Docs** — Creates `AGENTS.md` for each directory
3. **Root Docs** — Creates `CLAUDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `STACK.md`

---

### 4. Update Incrementally

```
/are:update
```

Only regenerates documentation for files that changed since last run.

## Generated Documentation

### `.sum` Files (Per File)

```yaml
---
file_type: service
generated_at: 2026-01-30T12:00:00Z
---

## Purpose
Handles user authentication via JWT tokens.

## Public Interface
- `authenticate(token: string): User`
- `generateToken(user: User): string`

## Dependencies
- jsonwebtoken: Token signing/verification
- ./user-repository: User data access

## Implementation Notes
Tokens expire after 24 hours. Refresh handled by client.
```

### `AGENTS.md` (Per Directory)

Directory overview with:

- Description of the directory's role
- Files grouped by purpose (Types, Services, Utils, etc.)
- Subdirectories with brief descriptions

### Root Documents

- **`CLAUDE.md`** — Project entry point for Claude Code (auto-loaded)
- **`AGENTS.md`** — Root directory overview (universal format)
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** — System design overview (generated for complex projects)
- **`STACK.md`** — Technology stack from package.json

---

## Configuration

Edit `.agents-reverse-engineer/config.yaml`:

```yaml
exclude:
  patterns: [] # Custom glob patterns
  vendorDirs: # Directories to skip
    - node_modules
    - dist
    - .git
  binaryExtensions: # File types to skip
    - .png
    - .jpg

options:
  followSymlinks: false
  maxFileSize: 1048576 # 1MB
```

---

## Requirements

- **Node.js 18+**
- **AI Coding Assistant** — One of:
  - [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) (full support)
  - [OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode) (AGENTS.md supported)
  - Any assistant supporting `AGENTS.md` format
