# src/types

Central type definition directory exporting shared TypeScript interfaces for file discovery results (`DiscoveryResult`), exclusion metadata (`ExcludedFile`), and discovery statistics (`DiscoveryStats`). These interfaces form the contract between the discovery pipeline (`src/discovery/`) and downstream consumers (CLI commands, generation orchestrator, quality validators, plan tracker).

## Contents

### [index.ts](./index.ts)
Exports three core interfaces: `ExcludedFile` (path + exclusion reason), `DiscoveryResult` (approved files array + excluded files array), `DiscoveryStats` (count aggregates + exclusion reason histogram). Consumed by `src/cli/discover.ts` for reporting, `src/generation/orchestrator.ts` for Phase 1 task queue construction, `src/orchestration/plan-tracker.ts` for GENERATION-PLAN.md serialization, and `src/quality/` validators for documentation coverage checks. Produced by `src/discovery/walker.ts` and `src/discovery/filters/` chain.

## Data Flow

**Producers:**
- `walker.ts` aggregates filter results into `DiscoveryResult` with `files[]` and `excluded[]`
- `filters/` modules (gitignore, binary, vendor, custom) append `ExcludedFile` entries with filter-specific reasons

**Consumers:**
- `cli/discover.ts` formats `DiscoveryStats` for terminal output (included/excluded counts, exclusion histogram)
- `generation/orchestrator.ts` reads `DiscoveryResult.files` to populate Phase 1 worker pool task queue
- `orchestration/plan-tracker.ts` serializes `DiscoveryResult` into GENERATION-PLAN.md file/directory counts
- `quality/` validators check `DiscoveryResult.files` against generated `.sum`/`AGENTS.md` for coverage gaps

## Interface Contracts

**ExcludedFile:**
- `path: string` — Absolute or relative file path excluded from analysis
- `reason: string` — Human-readable exclusion cause (e.g., "gitignore pattern", "binary file", "vendor directory")

**DiscoveryResult:**
- `files: string[]` — File paths approved for analysis (passed all filters)
- `excluded: ExcludedFile[]` — Files rejected with reasons

**DiscoveryStats:**
- `totalFiles: number` — Count of all files found during traversal
- `includedFiles: number` — Count approved for analysis
- `excludedFiles: number` — Count rejected by filters
- `exclusionReasons: Record<string, number>` — Histogram of exclusion reasons (reason string keys, frequency values)
