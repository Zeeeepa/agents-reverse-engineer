**Defines core shared types for file discovery results and statistics used across the ARE tool.**

## Exported Types

### ExcludedFile
Interface representing a file excluded from documentation generation:
- `path: string` — absolute or relative path to excluded file
- `reason: string` — exclusion reason (e.g., "gitignore pattern", "binary file", "vendor directory")

### DiscoveryResult
Interface representing the outcome of the file discovery process:
- `files: string[]` — list of file paths selected for analysis
- `excluded: ExcludedFile[]` — list of excluded files with their reasons

### DiscoveryStats
Interface providing metrics about the discovery process:
- `totalFiles: number` — total files found during traversal
- `includedFiles: number` — count of files selected for analysis
- `excludedFiles: number` — count of excluded files
- `exclusionReasons: Record<string, number>` — map of reason strings to occurrence counts

## Usage Context

These types flow through the discovery phase (`src/discovery/`), consumed by filters (`src/discovery/filters/`) and referenced in CLI commands (`src/cli/discover.ts`). DiscoveryResult feeds into generation orchestration (`src/generation/orchestrator.ts`) to determine which files receive `.sum` documentation. DiscoveryStats supports telemetry and progress reporting (`src/orchestration/progress.ts`).
