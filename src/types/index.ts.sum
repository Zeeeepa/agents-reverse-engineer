**index.ts defines shared TypeScript interfaces for file discovery results, exclusion tracking, and statistics aggregation used across ARE modules.**

## Exported Interfaces

### ExcludedFile
Represents a file excluded during discovery with metadata:
- `path: string` — Absolute or relative path to excluded file
- `reason: string` — Exclusion rationale (e.g., "gitignore pattern", "binary file", "vendor directory")

### DiscoveryResult
Output contract for file discovery process:
- `files: string[]` — Paths of files selected for analysis
- `excluded: ExcludedFile[]` — Files rejected with explanatory reasons

### DiscoveryStats
Aggregated metrics from discovery execution:
- `totalFiles: number` — Count of all files encountered
- `includedFiles: number` — Count selected for analysis
- `excludedFiles: number` — Count rejected by filters
- `exclusionReasons: Record<string, number>` — Histogram mapping reason strings to occurrence counts

## Integration Points

Consumed by `src/discovery/walker.ts` as return types for directory traversal functions. Used by `src/cli/discover.ts` to format console output and write `GENERATION-PLAN.md`. Referenced in `src/orchestration/runner.ts` for telemetry logging of discovery phase metrics.
