**Defines TypeScript interfaces for the three-phase documentation generation pipeline: `AnalysisResult` for Phase 1 file analysis output, `SummaryMetadata` for extracted file metadata, and `SummaryOptions` for controlling summary generation behavior.**

## Exported Types

**`AnalysisResult`** — Represents the output of Phase 1 file analysis, populated by LLM subprocess calls via `AIService.call()`. Contains two properties:
- `summary: string` — Generated summary text written to `.sum` files
- `metadata: SummaryMetadata` — Structured metadata extracted during analysis

**`SummaryMetadata`** — Structured metadata extracted from source files during analysis, written to `.sum` file YAML frontmatter alongside `generated_at` and `content_hash`. Contains:
- `purpose: string` — Primary purpose statement for the file (mandatory)
- `criticalTodos?: string[]` — Optional array of security/breaking issues only (not general TODOs)
- `relatedFiles?: string[]` — Optional array of tightly coupled sibling file paths

**`SummaryOptions`** — Configuration for controlling summary generation output format. Contains:
- `targetLength: 'short' | 'standard' | 'detailed'` — Target verbosity level for generated summaries
- `includeCodeSnippets: boolean` — Whether to embed code examples in output

## Integration Points

Referenced by `src/generation/executor.ts` for Phase 1 concurrent file analysis tasks, consumed by `src/generation/writers/sum.ts` for `.sum` file serialization with YAML frontmatter, and used by prompt builders in `src/generation/prompts/builder.ts` for configuring LLM analysis requests.
