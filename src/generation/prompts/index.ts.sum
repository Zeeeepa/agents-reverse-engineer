**Barrel export module that re-exports prompt building functions and types from the generation/prompts subsystem.**

## Exported Symbols

Exports `PromptContext` type from `'./types.js'` — represents context data passed to prompt builders (file paths, content, language detection, etc.).

Exports `SUMMARY_GUIDELINES` constant from `'./types.js'` — contains the core prompt text defining documentation generation rules (density requirements, identifier preservation, format constraints).

Exports `buildFilePrompt` function from `'./builder.js'` — constructs AI prompt for analyzing individual source files and generating .sum documentation.

Exports `buildDirectoryPrompt` function from `'./builder.js'` — constructs AI prompt for synthesizing directory-level AGENTS.md from child .sum files.

Exports `buildRootPrompt` function from `'./builder.js'` — constructs AI prompt for generating root AGENTS.md from all directory-level documentation.

Exports `detectLanguage` function from `'./builder.js'` — infers programming language from file extension for context-aware prompt generation.

## Module Role

Centralizes prompt generation API surface for the three-phase documentation pipeline: file analysis → directory synthesis → root aggregation. Consumed by `src/generation/executor.ts` orchestration logic and `src/cli/` command handlers.
