**Exports template constants for AI-driven file analysis, directory indexing, and root documentation generation prompts used by builder.ts.**

## Exported Constants

### FILE_SYSTEM_PROMPT
System prompt instructing AI to generate dense, identifier-rich file summaries for `FILE_USER_PROMPT`. Enforces mandatory density rules (every sentence references specific identifiers), anchor term preservation (exact exported names preserved), and format constraints (bold purpose statement first, no preamble). Prohibits filler phrases ("this file", "provides", "responsible for") and requires technical shorthand ("exports X, Y, Z").

### FILE_USER_PROMPT
User prompt template for file-level analysis consumed by `buildFilePrompt()` in builder.ts. Contains `{{FILE_PATH}}` and `{{CONTENT}}` placeholders for file path and source code. Includes hardcoded project structure tree (./LANGUAGES-MANIFEST.md through src/update/types.ts) for cross-file context. Mandates bold purpose statement and ## headings with exported symbols.

### DIRECTORY_SYSTEM_PROMPT
System prompt for AGENTS.md directory-level generation consumed by `buildDirectoryPrompt()` in builder.ts. Requires first line `<!-- Generated by agents-reverse-engineer -->` and adaptive section selection (Contents, Subdirectories, Architecture/Data Flow, Stack, Structure, Patterns, Configuration, API Surface). Enforces path accuracy (use Import Map paths only, no invented module references), consistency (no self-contradiction within document), and density rules (reference identifiers, avoid filler). Handles User Notes prepending (notes included separately, do not repeat in output).

### ROOT_SYSTEM_PROMPT
System prompt for root CLAUDE.md generation consumed by `buildRootPrompt()` in builder.ts. Constrains AI to synthesize only from provided AGENTS.md content without hallucination. Prohibits preamble, conversational text, or meta-commentary ("Here is...", "I've generated..."). Output written directly to file.

## Design Pattern

Template literal constants following Mustache-style placeholder convention (`{{VAR_NAME}}`). Builder module (builder.ts) performs string replacement to construct final prompts. Three-tier prompt architecture: file-level (FILE_*), directory-level (DIRECTORY_*), root-level (ROOT_*) corresponding to ARE's three-phase generation workflow.
