**Defines TypeScript types and constants for the prompt generation subsystem used during AI-driven file analysis.**

## Exported Types

### PromptContext
Interface passed to prompt builders containing:
- `filePath: string` - absolute path to the file being analyzed
- `content: string` - raw file content to analyze
- `contextFiles?: Array<{path: string; content: string}>` - optional related files for cross-file context
- `projectPlan?: string` - optional project structure listing for architectural awareness

## Exported Constants

### SUMMARY_GUIDELINES
Structured constant defining documentation generation rules sourced from CONTEXT.md:
- `targetLength: {min: 200, max: 300}` - word count bounds for .sum file output
- `include: string[]` - array of 6 required documentation elements (purpose, public interface, patterns, dependencies, signatures, coupled files)
- `exclude: string[]` - array of 3 forbidden content types (internal details, generic TODOs, broad architecture)

## Usage Context

PromptContext serves as input to `src/generation/prompts/builder.ts` functions that construct AI prompts for file analysis. The `contextFiles` field enables cross-reference analysis during concurrent file processing in `src/generation/executor.ts`. SUMMARY_GUIDELINES provides validation criteria consumed by quality checkers in `src/quality/` modules.
