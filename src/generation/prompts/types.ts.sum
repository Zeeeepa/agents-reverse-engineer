**types.ts defines TypeScript interfaces and constants for prompt construction in the three-phase documentation generation pipeline.**

## Exported Types

**PromptContext** interface structures the data bundle passed to prompt builders across all three generation phases:
- `filePath: string` — absolute path to target file for Phase 1 analysis or directory for Phase 2 aggregation
- `content: string` — file content (Phase 1) or aggregated child `.sum` content (Phase 2)
- `contextFiles?: Array<{ path: string; content: string }>` — optional sibling files for import relationship context
- `projectPlan?: string` — optional GENERATION-PLAN.md content providing bird's-eye view of codebase structure
- `existingSum?: string` — previous `.sum` content for incremental updates (enables diff-based regeneration)

## Summary Guidelines

**SUMMARY_GUIDELINES** constant exports frozen object with validation constraints for `.sum` file quality:

```typescript
{
  targetLength: { min: 200, max: 300 },
  include: [...],
  exclude: [...]
}
```

**`targetLength`** defines word count range (200-300) enforced by density validators in `src/quality/density/validator.ts`.

**`include`** array specifies required content elements:
- `'Purpose and responsibility'` — one-line purpose statement
- `'Public interface (exports, key functions)'` — exported symbols extracted by code-vs-doc validator (`src/quality/inconsistency/code-vs-doc.ts`)
- `'Key patterns and notable algorithms'` — design pattern identification (Strategy, Builder, etc.)
- `'Dependencies with usage context'` — import statements with usage rationale
- `'Key function signatures as code snippets'` — TypeScript/JavaScript signatures with parameter types
- `'Tightly coupled sibling files'` — related files detected via `extractDirectoryImports()` in `src/imports/extractor.ts`

**`exclude`** array defines content to omit:
- `'Internal implementation details'` — private functions, loop mechanics, variable names
- `'Generic TODOs/FIXMEs (keep only security/breaking)'` — filters low-priority comments
- `'Broad architectural relationships (handled by AGENTS.md)'` — defers system-level patterns to Phase 2 directory aggregation

## Integration Points

Consumed by `buildFileAnalysisPrompt()` and `buildDirectoryPrompt()` in `src/generation/prompts/builder.ts` to construct AI subprocess prompts. The `PromptContext` interface threads through `executePhase1()`, `executePhase2()`, `executePhase3()` in `src/generation/executor.ts` as input to `AIService.call()`.

Guidelines enforced during quality validation via `validateCodeDocConsistency()` and `validateCodeCodeConsistency()` in `src/quality/inconsistency/` modules, checking that all `include` items appear in generated summaries and no `exclude` items dominate the content.
