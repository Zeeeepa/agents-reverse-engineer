**Barrel module exporting file-level documentation writers (writeSumFile, readSumFile, getSumPath, sumFileExists, SumFileContent) from sum.js and directory-level documentation writer (writeAgentsMd) from agents-md.js.**

## Exported Symbols

- `writeSumFile`: function for writing `.sum` file documentation (file-level summaries)
- `readSumFile`: function for reading existing `.sum` files
- `getSumPath`: utility for resolving `.sum` file paths given a source file path
- `sumFileExists`: predicate checking existence of `.sum` file for a given source file
- `SumFileContent`: type representing the structure of parsed `.sum` file contents
- `writeAgentsMd`: function for generating `AGENTS.md` directory-level documentation

## Module Role

Centralizes access to the two-tier documentation writers used in the three-phase generation pipeline: sum.js handles atomic file-level summaries written during concurrent Phase 1, while agents-md.js handles directory-level AGENTS.md aggregation during post-order Phase 2.

## Integration Context

Consumed by `src/generation/orchestrator.ts` during the generation workflow and by `src/update/orchestrator.ts` during incremental updates. The sum.js exports support both writing new summaries and reading existing ones for change detection via `src/change-detection/detector.ts`.
