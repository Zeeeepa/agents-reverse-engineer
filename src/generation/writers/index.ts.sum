**index.ts re-exports writer utilities for .sum files and AGENTS.md generation.**

## Exported Symbols

**From `./sum.js`:**
- `writeSumFile` — Writes .sum files with YAML frontmatter containing `generated_at`, `content_hash`, `purpose`, `critical_todos`, `related_files`
- `readSumFile` — Parses existing .sum files, extracts YAML frontmatter and markdown body
- `getSumPath` — Computes .sum file path from source file path
- `sumFileExists` — Checks if .sum file exists for given source file
- `SumFileContent` — Type interface for .sum file structure with frontmatter fields and markdown content

**From `./agents-md.js`:**
- `writeAgentsMd` — Writes directory-level AGENTS.md files from aggregated child .sum content and subdirectory AGENTS.md files during Phase 2 post-order traversal

## Module Role

index.ts serves as public API boundary for `src/generation/writers/` directory. Consumers import writer functions via `import { writeSumFile, readSumFile, writeAgentsMd } from './generation/writers/index.js'` without accessing implementation modules directly. Central to Phase 1 file analysis (writeSumFile) and Phase 2 directory aggregation (writeAgentsMd) in three-phase pipeline. SumFileContent type defines contract for frontmatter schema including SHA-256 content_hash used by incremental update system.
