**Re-exports public interfaces from `sum.ts` and `agents-md.ts` to provide centralized access to file-level summary writers and directory-level aggregation writers used in the three-phase generation pipeline.**

## Exported Symbols

From `sum.ts`:
- `writeSumFile(filePath: string, content: SumFileContent, sumPath: string): Promise<void>` — writes `.sum` file with YAML frontmatter containing `generated_at`, `content_hash` (SHA-256), `purpose`, optional `critical_todos`, `related_files`
- `readSumFile(sumPath: string): Promise<SumFileContent>` — parses existing `.sum` file from YAML frontmatter plus markdown body
- `getSumPath(filePath: string): string` — computes `.sum` file path by appending `.sum` extension to source file path
- `sumFileExists(filePath: string): Promise<boolean>` — checks if `.sum` file exists for given source file via `fs.access()`
- `SumFileContent` type — discriminated union with frontmatter fields plus `summary: string` body content

From `agents-md.ts`:
- `writeAgentsMd(dirPath: string, content: string): Promise<void>` — writes directory-level `AGENTS.md` with generation marker comment, preserves existing `AGENTS.md` by renaming to `AGENTS.local.md` and prepending above generated content

## Integration Role

This barrel module serves as the public API boundary for Phase 1 (file analysis) and Phase 2 (directory aggregation) output operations within `src/generation/orchestrator.ts`, exposing only the minimal writer surface needed by the concurrent worker pool (`pool.ts`) and post-order directory traversal logic.
