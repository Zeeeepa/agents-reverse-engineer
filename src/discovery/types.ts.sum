**types.ts defines the core interfaces for the file discovery pipeline: FileFilter for exclusion logic, FilterResult for discovery outcomes, ExcludedFile for exclusion tracking, and WalkerOptions for directory traversal configuration.**

## Exported Interfaces

**FileFilter** - Synchronous or asynchronous predicate interface for excluding files during discovery. Contains `name: string` for filter identification and `shouldExclude(path: string, stats?: Stats): Promise<boolean> | boolean` for exclusion logic. Implemented by GitignoreFilter, BinaryFilter, VendorFilter, and CustomPatternFilter.

**ExcludedFile** - Record structure with `path: string` (absolute path), `reason: string` (human-readable exclusion cause), and `filter: string` (name of excluding filter). Used for tracking which filter rejected which file.

**FilterResult** - Discovery outcome container with `included: string[]` (files passing all filters) and `excluded: ExcludedFile[]` (rejected files with metadata). Returned by filter chain execution.

**WalkerOptions** - Configuration for directory traversal with `cwd: string` (absolute root path), optional `followSymlinks?: boolean` (default false per CONTEXT.md), and optional `dot?: boolean` (default true to include dotfiles).

## Dependencies

Imports `Stats` from `node:fs` for file metadata in `shouldExclude()` and `WalkerOptions`.

## Design Pattern

Strategy pattern via FileFilter interface enables composable filter chains where each filter independently decides exclusion based on different criteria (gitignore rules, binary detection, vendor paths, custom patterns).
