**walkDirectory traverses directory trees using fast-glob and returns all file paths before filter application.**

## Exported Functions

- `walkDirectory(options: WalkerOptions): Promise<string[]>` — walks directory tree starting from `options.cwd` and returns absolute paths to all discovered files

## Integration with Discovery Pipeline

walkDirectory returns unfiltered file lists consumed by `applyFilters()` in `src/discovery/filters/index.ts`. The `discoverFiles()` orchestrator in `src/discovery/run.ts` calls walkDirectory then applies four standard filters: GitignoreFilter, VendorFilter, BinaryFilter, and CustomPatternFilter.

## Configuration Surface

WalkerOptions accepts `cwd` (absolute directory path), `dot` (include dotfiles, default true), and `followSymlinks` (follow symbolic links, default false per CONTEXT.md).

## fast-glob Integration

Passes glob pattern `**/*` to `fg.glob()` with options `absolute: true`, `onlyFiles: true`, `dot` and `followSymbolicLinks` from WalkerOptions, `suppressErrors: true` to continue on permission errors, and hardcoded `ignore: ['**/.git/**']` for performance.

## Design Constraints

Walker deliberately returns all files without filtering — filter chain separation enforces single responsibility and enables filter composition in parent orchestrator. The `.git` directory exclusion is hardcoded as performance optimization not user-configurable filter logic.
