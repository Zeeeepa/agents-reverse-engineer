**Defines TypeScript interfaces and discriminated union types for AI coding assistant environment detection (Claude Code, OpenCode, Aider, Gemini) and integration template generation.**

## Exported Types

### EnvironmentType
Union type `'claude' | 'opencode' | 'aider' | 'gemini'` representing supported AI assistant platforms.

### DetectedEnvironment
Interface describing environment detection results with properties:
- `type: EnvironmentType` — Platform identifier
- `configDir: string` — Configuration directory path (e.g., `.claude`, `.opencode`)
- `detected: boolean` — Whether environment was found in project

### IntegrationTemplate
Interface defining template structure for command files and hooks with properties:
- `filename: string` — File name (e.g., `generate.md`)
- `path: string` — Relative path from project root (e.g., `.claude/commands/ar/generate.md`)
- `content: string` — Template content to write

### IntegrationResult
Interface describing integration file generation outcome with properties:
- `environment: EnvironmentType` — Platform that was configured
- `filesCreated: string[]` — Successfully written file paths
- `filesSkipped: string[]` — Paths skipped due to existing files

## Integration with Module

Consumed by `src/integration/detect.ts` for environment detection logic, `src/integration/generate.ts` for template instantiation, and `src/integration/templates.ts` for platform-specific content generation. Supports installer workflow in `src/installer/` for command/hook registration during `npx agents-reverse-engineer --runtime <env>` execution.
