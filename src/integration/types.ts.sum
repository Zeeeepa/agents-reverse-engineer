**Defines TypeScript types for AI coding assistant environment detection and integration template generation across Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini, and Aider platforms.**

## Exported Types

### EnvironmentType
```typescript
type EnvironmentType = 'claude' | 'opencode' | 'aider' | 'gemini'
```
String literal union representing supported AI assistant platforms.

### DetectedEnvironment
```typescript
interface DetectedEnvironment {
  type: EnvironmentType;
  configDir: string;
  detected: boolean;
}
```
Represents discovery result from environment detection: `type` identifies the AI platform, `configDir` stores the configuration directory path (e.g., `.claude`, `.opencode`), `detected` boolean indicates presence in project.

### IntegrationTemplate
```typescript
interface IntegrationTemplate {
  filename: string;
  path: string;
  content: string;
}
```
Describes a single integration file to be written: `filename` is the base name (e.g., `'generate.md'`), `path` is the relative path from project root (e.g., `.claude/commands/ar/generate.md`), `content` holds the template text to write.

### IntegrationResult
```typescript
interface IntegrationResult {
  environment: EnvironmentType;
  filesCreated: string[];
  filesSkipped: string[];
}
```
Aggregates outcome of integration file generation: `environment` identifies the target platform, `filesCreated` lists successfully written file paths, `filesSkipped` tracks paths that existed and were not overwritten.

## Integration Points

Used by `src/integration/detect.ts` for environment detection return values and by `src/integration/generate.ts` for template construction and file writing results. Consumed by `src/installer/operations.ts` during npx-based command/hook installation workflow.
