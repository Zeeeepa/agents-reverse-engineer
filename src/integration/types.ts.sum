**Defines TypeScript interfaces for AI coding assistant environment detection and integration template generation across platforms (Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini, Aider).**

## Type Definitions

**`EnvironmentType`** — String literal union type enumerating supported AI assistant platforms: `'claude' | 'opencode' | 'aider' | 'gemini'`.

**`DetectedEnvironment`** — Interface representing environment detection results with fields:
- `type: EnvironmentType` — Detected AI assistant platform identifier
- `configDir: string` — Configuration directory path (e.g., `.claude`, `.opencode`)
- `detected: boolean` — Boolean flag indicating whether environment was found in project

**`IntegrationTemplate`** — Interface representing a single integration file to be generated with fields:
- `filename: string` — Base filename (e.g., `'generate.md'`)
- `path: string` — Relative path from project root (e.g., `.claude/commands/ar/generate.md`)
- `content: string` — Template content to write to filesystem

**`IntegrationResult`** — Interface representing batch integration generation outcome with fields:
- `environment: EnvironmentType` — Target AI assistant platform
- `filesCreated: string[]` — Array of successfully written file paths
- `filesSkipped: string[]` — Array of file paths skipped due to existing files

## Integration Points

Consumed by `src/integration/detect.ts` for environment detection logic and `src/integration/generate.ts` for template generation workflows. Used by `src/installer/operations.ts` to orchestrate IDE-specific command/hook installation. Referenced in `src/cli/init.ts` for initialization flows requiring platform-specific configuration.
