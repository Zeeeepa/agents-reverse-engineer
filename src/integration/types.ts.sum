**Defines TypeScript interfaces for AI coding assistant environment detection and integration template generation, supporting Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini, and Aider runtime environments.**

## Exported Types

**EnvironmentType**: String literal union type with values `'claude' | 'opencode' | 'aider' | 'gemini'` representing supported AI assistant platforms.

**DetectedEnvironment**: Interface describing discovered AI assistant environment with fields:
- `type: EnvironmentType` — AI assistant platform identifier
- `configDir: string` — Configuration directory path (e.g., `.claude`, `.opencode`)
- `detected: boolean` — Whether environment was found in project

**IntegrationTemplate**: Interface modeling integration file template with fields:
- `filename: string` — File name without path (e.g., `generate.md`)
- `path: string` — Full relative path from project root (e.g., `.claude/commands/ar/generate.md`)
- `content: string` — Template content to write

**IntegrationResult**: Interface capturing integration file generation outcome with fields:
- `environment: EnvironmentType` — Target environment type
- `filesCreated: string[]` — Successfully written file paths
- `filesSkipped: string[]` — Existing file paths skipped during generation

## Integration Context

Used by `src/integration/detect.ts` for environment detection via config directory scanning and manifest file presence checks. Consumed by `src/integration/generate.ts` to orchestrate template writing for command files and session hooks. Templates sourced from `src/integration/templates.ts` which constructs platform-specific markdown/TOML/JavaScript content. Installation orchestrated by `src/installer/operations.ts` which prompts user for runtime selection and invokes generation workflow.
