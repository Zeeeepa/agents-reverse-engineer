**Defines TypeScript interfaces for representing import statements extracted from source files via static analysis.**

## Exported Types

### ImportEntry
Represents a single import statement extracted from source code.

**Properties:**
- `specifier: string` — Raw import path as written in source (e.g., `'../ai/index.js'`)
- `symbols: string[]` — Array of imported identifiers (e.g., `['AIService', 'AIResponse']`)
- `typeOnly: boolean` — Discriminates TypeScript type-only imports (`import type { ... }`)

### FileImports
Aggregates all imports discovered in a single source file, partitioned by locality.

**Properties:**
- `fileName: string` — Relative file path (e.g., `'runner.ts'`)
- `externalImports: ImportEntry[]` — Imports from other modules or parent/sibling directories
- `internalImports: ImportEntry[]` — Imports from same directory as the source file

## Design Patterns

**Locality-based partitioning:** The `externalImports`/`internalImports` separation supports dependency graph construction where internal imports indicate tight coupling within a directory module, while external imports reveal cross-module dependencies. This distinction is used by `src/generation/prompts/builder.ts` when constructing import maps for AI prompts during Phase 1 file analysis.

## Integration Points

Consumed by:
- `src/imports/extractor.ts` — Parses TypeScript/JavaScript source via regex to produce `FileImports` instances
- `src/generation/prompts/builder.ts` — Includes `externalImports` in file analysis prompts to provide dependency context
- `src/generation/prompts/templates.ts` — Aggregates directory-level imports from child `FileImports` for `AGENTS.md` generation
