**Defines TypeScript interfaces for representing import statements extracted from source files during static analysis.**

## Exported Types

### ImportEntry
Represents a single import statement with three properties:
- `specifier: string` — Raw import path as written in source (e.g., `'../ai/index.js'`)
- `symbols: string[]` — Array of imported identifiers (e.g., `['AIService', 'AIResponse']`)
- `typeOnly: boolean` — Flag indicating TypeScript type-only imports (`import type { ... }`)

### FileImports
Aggregates all imports from a single source file with three properties:
- `fileName: string` — Relative file path (e.g., `'runner.ts'`)
- `externalImports: ImportEntry[]` — Imports from other modules (not same directory)
- `internalImports: ImportEntry[]` — Imports from same directory

## Integration Points

Used by `src/imports/extractor.ts` which performs regex-based import parsing to populate these structures. The `FileImports` interface feeds into `src/generation/prompts/builder.ts` via `extractDirectoryImports()` to construct import maps included in directory aggregation prompts during Phase 2 of the documentation pipeline.
