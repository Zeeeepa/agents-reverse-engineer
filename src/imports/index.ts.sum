**Barrel module re-exporting static import analysis utilities for dependency tracking and documentation generation.**

## Exported Symbols

- `extractImports`: Function for analyzing import statements in a single source file
- `extractDirectoryImports`: Function for aggregating imports across multiple files in a directory
- `formatImportMap`: Function for serializing import data structures into human-readable format
- `ImportEntry`: Type representing a single import statement (source module, imported symbols, import type)
- `FileImports`: Type representing all imports for a single file

## Module Role

This barrel module serves as the public API boundary for the imports subsystem within the ARE tool. The actual implementation resides in `./extractor.js` and `./types.js`, following the pattern of separating interface definitions from implementation logic. The imports subsystem enables ARE to track cross-file dependencies when generating AGENTS.md documentation, allowing the AI to understand coupling between modules.

## Integration Context

The import extraction functions are consumed by `src/generation/orchestrator.ts` during the documentation generation phase to populate dependency graphs and identify integration points between source files. The `formatImportMap` output appears in generated `.sum` files to provide AI assistants with explicit module dependency information.
