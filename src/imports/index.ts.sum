**Barrel export module re-exporting import extraction functionality from `extractor.ts` and type definitions from `types.ts`.**

## Exported Functions

- `extractImports` — Extracts import statements from a single source file
- `extractDirectoryImports` — Aggregates imports across all files within a directory
- `formatImportMap` — Formats collected import data into human-readable map representation

## Exported Types

- `ImportEntry` — Represents a single import statement with source module and imported identifiers
- `FileImports` — Container type associating a file path with its array of ImportEntry records

## Integration Points

This module serves as the public API surface for the `src/imports/` subsystem, consumed by `src/generation/prompts/builder.ts` during Phase 2 directory aggregation to construct import maps included in directory-level AGENTS.md prompts via `extractDirectoryImports()`.
