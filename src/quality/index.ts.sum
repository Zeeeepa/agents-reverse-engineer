**Public API aggregation module re-exporting quality analysis components for inconsistency detection, phantom path validation, and density analysis.**

## Exported Types

Re-exports discriminated union types from `./types.js`:
- `InconsistencySeverity` — severity enum for validation issues
- `CodeDocInconsistency` — mismatches between exported symbols and summary documentation
- `CodeCodeInconsistency` — duplicate symbol declarations across files
- `PhantomPathInconsistency` — unresolved path references in AGENTS.md files
- `Inconsistency` — discriminated union of all inconsistency types
- `InconsistencyReport` — structured report containing metadata, issues array, and summary counts

Re-exports from `./density/validator.js`:
- `FindabilityResult` — validation result type for density analysis

## Code-vs-Doc Validation

Re-exports from `./inconsistency/code-vs-doc.js`:
- `extractExports(fileContent: string): string[]` — extracts exported symbols via regex pattern `/^[ \t]*export\s+(?:default\s+)?(?:function|class|const|let|var|type|interface|enum)\s+(\w+)/gm`
- `checkCodeVsDoc(...)` — verifies all exports appear in `.sum` summary text via substring search, returns `CodeDocInconsistency[]` with `missingFromDoc` arrays

## Code-vs-Code Duplicate Detection

Re-exports from `./inconsistency/code-vs-code.js`:
- `checkCodeVsCode(...)` — aggregates exports across per-directory file groups into `Map<symbol, string[]>`, reports duplicate symbols appearing in multiple files with pattern `'duplicate-export'`

## Phantom Path Detection

Re-exports from `./phantom-paths/index.js`:
- `checkPhantomPaths(...)` — extracts path-like strings from `AGENTS.md` via three regex patterns (markdown links, backtick-quoted paths, prose-embedded paths), resolves against file system with `.ts`/`.js` fallback, returns `PhantomPathInconsistency[]`

## Inconsistency Reporting

Re-exports from `./inconsistency/reporter.js`:
- `buildInconsistencyReport(...)` — constructs `InconsistencyReport` with metadata (timestamp, projectRoot, filesChecked, durationMs), aggregated issues array, and summary counts by type/severity
- `formatReportForCli(...)` — renders report as terminal-formatted string with picocolors styling

## Density Validation

Re-exports from `./density/validator.js`:
- `validateFindability(...)` — disabled feature after `publicInterface` removal from `SumFileContent` schema, validates identifier density in summaries

## Module Pattern

Barrel export pattern centralizing all quality analysis exports under single namespace `src/quality/`. Consumers import from this index rather than deep module paths, enabling refactoring of internal directory structure without breaking external imports.
