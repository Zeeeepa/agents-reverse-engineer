**Barrel export module re-exporting `checkPhantomPaths` validator for detecting unresolved file path references in generated `AGENTS.md` documentation.**

## Exports

- `checkPhantomPaths` — Re-exported from `./validator.js`, validates that path-like strings extracted from `AGENTS.md` files resolve to actual source files

## Module Role

Entry point for phantom-paths quality validation subsystem. Consolidates path resolution checking into single import surface for consumption by `src/quality/index.ts` quality orchestrator and `src/cli/generate.ts`/`src/cli/update.ts` command handlers.

## Integration Points

Consumed by `src/quality/index.ts` which aggregates all quality validators (`checkPhantomPaths`, `checkCodeVsDoc`, `checkCodeVsCode`) into unified `InconsistencyReport`. Implementation logic resides in `./validator.ts` which extracts paths via regex patterns (markdown links, backtick-quoted paths, prose-embedded paths), resolves against project root with `.ts`/`.js` fallback, and returns `PhantomPathInconsistency` objects for unresolved references.
