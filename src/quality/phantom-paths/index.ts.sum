**Exports the `checkPhantomPaths` validator function from the phantom-paths quality validation module.**

## Public Interface

```typescript
export { checkPhantomPaths } from './validator.js'
```

Exports `checkPhantomPaths` function which detects unresolved path references in `AGENTS.md` files via three regex patterns: markdown link targets (`/\[(?:[^\]]*)\]\((\.[^)]+)\)/g`), backtick-quoted paths (`` /`((?:src\/|\.\.?\/)[^`]+\.[a-z]{1,4})`/g ``), and prose-embedded paths (`/(?:from|in|by|via|see)\s+`?(src\/[\w\-./]+)`?/gi`), then resolves against the AGENTS.md directory and project root with `.ts`/`.js` fallback extensions, returning `PhantomPathInconsistency` instances for unresolved references.

## Module Role

Serves as the public API entry point for the phantom-paths quality validator within the three-validator quality system (`src/quality/index.ts` aggregates code-vs-doc, code-vs-code, and phantom-paths validators). The `checkPhantomPaths` function is invoked during Phase 2 (directory aggregation) and Phase 3 (root synthesis) to validate `AGENTS.md` path references correspond to actual files in the codebase, preventing documentation drift where referenced files have been moved, renamed, or deleted.

## Integration Context

Called by `src/generation/orchestrator.ts` after `AGENTS.md` generation, receiving `DiscoveryResult.files[]` and generated `AGENTS.md` paths as inputs. Results are merged into `InconsistencyReport` via `src/quality/inconsistency/reporter.ts` and logged to `progress.log` with counts by severity (error/warning/info).
