**Barrel module re-exporting `checkPhantomPaths` validator function for phantom path resolution in generated AGENTS.md documentation.**

## Exported Interface

- `checkPhantomPaths` — Validates path references in AGENTS.md files by resolving them against the filesystem and reporting unresolved paths as `PhantomPathInconsistency` issues.

## Module Role

Single export statement serving as public API surface for the `src/quality/phantom-paths/` subsystem. Implementation resides in `./validator.js` which extracts path-like strings from AGENTS.md via three regex patterns (markdown link targets, backtick-quoted paths, prose-embedded paths), resolves against AGENTS.md directory and project root with `.ts`/`.js` fallback, and reports unresolved references in `InconsistencyReport` format.
