**Re-exports `checkPhantomPaths` validator function from `./validator.js` as the public interface for phantom path detection.**

## Exported Interface

Exports `checkPhantomPaths` function from `./validator.js` module, providing access to the phantom path validation subsystem that detects unresolvable file references in generated `AGENTS.md` documentation.

## Module Role

Serves as the barrel export for the `src/quality/phantom-paths/` subsystem within the larger quality validation pipeline (`src/quality/index.ts`). This pattern centralizes the phantom path detection capability behind a single import point while keeping implementation details isolated in `validator.ts`.
