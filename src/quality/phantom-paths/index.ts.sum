**Re-exports `checkPhantomPaths` validator for phantom path detection in generated documentation.**

## Exported Interface

- `checkPhantomPaths` — Re-exported from `./validator.js`, function implementing phantom path validation for `AGENTS.md` files

## Module Purpose

Barrel export consolidating phantom path validation functionality. Provides single import point for consumers needing to detect unresolvable file path references embedded in generated documentation.

## Integration Context

Part of quality validation subsystem (`src/quality/`) alongside code-vs-doc consistency checking (`src/quality/inconsistency/code-vs-doc.ts`) and code-vs-code duplicate detection (`src/quality/inconsistency/code-vs-code.ts`). Invoked during post-generation validation phase to identify broken path references that may mislead AI coding assistants.

## Implementation Location

Core validation logic resides in `./validator.ts` which extracts path-like strings from `AGENTS.md` using three regex patterns:
- Markdown link targets: `/\[(?:[^\]]*)\]\((\.[^)]+)\)/g`
- Backtick-quoted paths: `` /`((?:src\/|\.\.?\/)[^`]+\.[a-z]{1,4})`/g ``
- Prose-embedded paths: `/(?:from|in|by|via|see)\s+`?(src\/[\w\-./]+)`?/gi`

Resolves paths against AGENTS.md directory and project root with `.ts`/`.js` extension fallback, reporting `PhantomPathInconsistency` for unresolved references.
