**Re-exports `checkPhantomPaths` from `./validator.js` to provide a single entry point for phantom path validation functionality.**

## Exported Symbols

- `checkPhantomPaths`: Re-exported from `./validator.js` — delegates to validator module for detecting phantom path references (documented links that point to non-existent files in the codebase).

## Module Role

Barrel export pattern for the `quality/phantom-paths/` subsystem. Centralizes access to phantom path detection, which validates that cross-reference paths in generated `.sum` files and `AGENTS.md` documents resolve to actual discovered files. Consumed by quality orchestration in `src/quality/index.ts` during the validation phase of `are-generate` and `are-update` commands.
