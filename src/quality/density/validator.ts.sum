**validator.ts implements findability validation checking that exported symbols from .sum files appear in parent AGENTS.md content, currently disabled pending structured metadata extraction re-implementation.**

## Current Status

validateFindability returns empty array since SumFileContent no longer includes `metadata.publicInterface` field removed in prior refactor. Function signature preserved for future post-processing pass implementation using structured symbol extraction.

## Exported Interface

**FindabilityResult** interface describes validation outcome per .sum file:
- `filePath: string` — Path to validated .sum file
- `symbolsTested: string[]` — Symbol names checked for presence
- `symbolsFound: string[]` — Symbols appearing in AGENTS.md
- `symbolsMissing: string[]` — Symbols absent from AGENTS.md
- `score: number` — Ratio of found/tested ranging 0 (no symbols found) to 1 (all symbols found)

**validateFindability** function signature takes `_agentsMdContent: string` (full AGENTS.md text) and `_sumFiles: Map<string, SumFileContent>` (parsed sum file mapping), returns `FindabilityResult[]` (currently empty array). Parameters prefixed with underscore indicating unused status until re-implementation.

## Design Intent

No LLM calls — purely string-based symbol matching heuristic. Original design verified key exported symbols from child .sum files appear in synthesized parent AGENTS.md content to detect documentation omissions. Relied on structured `publicInterface` metadata extraction during .sum file generation phase.

## Integration Context

Module retained in `src/quality/density/` alongside `src/quality/inconsistency/` validators (code-vs-doc, code-vs-code) and `src/quality/phantom-paths/` validators. Quality validation pipeline invoked post-generation via `src/quality/index.ts` orchestrator producing `InconsistencyReport` with metadata/issues/summary sections.
