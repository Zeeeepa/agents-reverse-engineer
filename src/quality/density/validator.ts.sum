**validator.ts implements a disabled findability validation system that previously checked whether exported symbols from .sum files appeared in parent AGENTS.md content, now returning empty results after structured metadata removal.**

## Exported Interface

`FindabilityResult` represents validation output for a single .sum file with fields:
- `filePath: string` — path to the validated .sum file
- `symbolsTested: string[]` — symbol names checked for presence
- `symbolsFound: string[]` — symbols located in AGENTS.md content
- `symbolsMissing: string[]` — symbols absent from AGENTS.md
- `score: number` — ratio of found to tested symbols (0-1 range)

## Exported Function

`validateFindability(_agentsMdContent: string, _sumFiles: Map<string, SumFileContent>): FindabilityResult[]` accepts AGENTS.md full text and a map of file paths to parsed `SumFileContent` objects, returns an empty array since the `publicInterface` field was removed from the `SumFileContent` schema. Function signature preserved for future re-implementation via post-processing passes that extract structured symbols.

## Implementation Status

Module retained as stub after `metadata.publicInterface` removal from `SumFileContent` schema (referenced in comment). Originally performed heuristic string-based symbol matching without LLM calls to verify that key exports from source files appeared in aggregated directory documentation. The `validateFindability` function signature remains to support future structured extraction support, but currently no validation logic executes.

## Dependencies

Imports `SumFileContent` type from `../../generation/writers/sum.js` for the `_sumFiles` parameter type annotation.
