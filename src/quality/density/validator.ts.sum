**validator.ts defines findability validation interfaces and a stub function to verify that exported symbols from .sum files appear in parent AGENTS.md content.**

## Exported Types

`FindabilityResult` interface represents validation results for a single .sum file:
- `filePath: string` — path to the validated .sum file
- `symbolsTested: string[]` — symbol names checked for presence
- `symbolsFound: string[]` — symbols found in AGENTS.md
- `symbolsMissing: string[]` — symbols absent from AGENTS.md
- `score: number` — ratio of found to tested symbols, range [0, 1]

## Exported Functions

`validateFindability(_agentsMdContent: string, _sumFiles: Map<string, SumFileContent>): FindabilityResult[]` returns an empty array because structured metadata extraction (publicInterface) was removed. Function signature preserved for future re-implementation via post-processing passes. No LLM calls, intended for string-based symbol matching.

## Dependencies

Imports `SumFileContent` from `../../generation/writers/sum.js` for type checking .sum file content structure.

## Current State

Function body returns `[]` — effectively disabled. Module retained as placeholder for future structured extraction support when publicInterface or equivalent metadata becomes available.
