**validator.ts implements stub findability validation for AGENTS.md symbol coverage, currently disabled after removal of structured `publicInterface` metadata from SumFileContent schema.**

## Exported Interfaces

`FindabilityResult` represents validation outcome for a single `.sum` file with fields:
- `filePath: string` — path to validated `.sum` file
- `symbolsTested: string[]` — symbol names checked for presence
- `symbolsFound: string[]` — symbols found in AGENTS.md content
- `symbolsMissing: string[]` — symbols absent from AGENTS.md content
- `score: number` — ratio of found to tested symbols (0.0 to 1.0)

## Exported Functions

`validateFindability(_agentsMdContent: string, _sumFiles: Map<string, SumFileContent>): FindabilityResult[]` returns empty array `[]` unconditionally. Function signature preserved for future re-implementation via post-processing passes that extract structured symbols from `.sum` files. Parameters prefixed with underscore indicate unused status.

## Design Context

Module originally validated that exported symbols from `.sum` files appeared in parent `AGENTS.md` content via string-based substring matching (no LLM calls). Validation logic removed after `SumFileContent.metadata.publicInterface` field was deleted from schema (referenced in comment: "Previously relied on metadata.publicInterface which has been removed"). Retention rationale stated in comment: "This module is retained for future structured extraction support."

## Integration Points

Imported by `src/quality/index.ts` which aggregates quality validators. `SumFileContent` type imported from `src/generation/writers/sum.ts`. Return type `FindabilityResult[]` consumed by quality reporting pipeline but produces no findings in current implementation.
