**Density validator module providing findability heuristics for AGENTS.md content by verifying exported symbol presence from .sum files (currently disabled due to publicInterface metadata removal).**

## Current Status

`validateFindability()` returns empty array since structured `publicInterface` extraction was removed from `SumFileContent` schema. Function signature preserved for future re-implementation via post-processing passes. No LLM calls—purely string-based symbol matching design.

## Exported Interfaces

**FindabilityResult** represents validation outcome for single .sum file:
- `filePath: string` - Path to checked .sum file
- `symbolsTested: string[]` - Symbol names tested for presence
- `symbolsFound: string[]` - Symbol names found in AGENTS.md
- `symbolsMissing: string[]` - Symbol names absent from AGENTS.md
- `score: number` - Ratio of found/tested symbols (0-1 range)

## Exported Functions

**validateFindability(\_agentsMdContent: string, \_sumFiles: Map<string, SumFileContent>): FindabilityResult[]** checks key symbols from .sum files appear in AGENTS.md content. Parameters prefixed with underscore indicate unused status. Returns empty array until structured metadata extraction restored.

## Integration Points

Imports `SumFileContent` from `../../generation/writers/sum.js` for type constraints on .sum file parsing. Called by quality validation orchestration in `src/quality/index.ts` alongside code-vs-doc and phantom-path validators.

## Design Pattern

Heuristic validation without AI inference—symbol presence determined via substring search in AGENTS.md text. Contrasts with `src/quality/inconsistency/code-vs-doc.ts` which performs regex-based export extraction from source files.

## Relation to Other Validators

Part of three-validator suite:
- **code-vs-doc** (`src/quality/inconsistency/code-vs-doc.ts`): regex extraction of exports from source, substring search in .sum summaries
- **code-vs-code** (`src/quality/inconsistency/code-vs-code.ts`): duplicate symbol detection across directory file groups
- **phantom-paths** (`src/quality/phantom-paths/validator.ts`): path resolution for references in AGENTS.md
- **density** (this file): symbol findability in AGENTS.md from .sum metadata (disabled)
