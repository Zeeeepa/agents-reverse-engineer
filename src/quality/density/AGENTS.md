# src/quality/density

Disabled findability validator that would verify AGENTS.md coverage of exported symbols from `.sum` file metadata (awaiting structured `publicInterface` extraction restoration).

## Contents

**[validator.ts](./validator.ts)** — `validateFindability()` returns empty array since `SumFileContent.publicInterface` removal in schema. Signature preserved: accepts `agentsMdContent` string and `sumFiles` map, would return `FindabilityResult[]` with per-file symbol presence analysis (tested/found/missing arrays, coverage score 0-1). Design: substring search for symbols in AGENTS.md text without LLM inference, contrasts with code-vs-doc's regex-based export extraction from source files.

## Architecture

Non-AI heuristic validator using string matching to compute symbol findability scores. Imports `SumFileContent` from `../../generation/writers/sum.js` for type constraints. Called by `src/quality/index.ts` quality orchestration alongside `code-vs-doc`, `code-vs-code`, `phantom-paths` validators. Disabled state prevents execution until post-processing pass restores structured metadata extraction to `.sum` file frontmatter.

## Exported Interface

**FindabilityResult** — Validation outcome with `filePath`, `symbolsTested`, `symbolsFound`, `symbolsMissing` string arrays, `score` ratio (found/tested).

## Relation to Quality Suite

Fourth validator in suite:
- `code-vs-doc` (regex export extraction vs substring search in summaries)
- `code-vs-code` (duplicate symbol detection via `Map<symbol, string[]>` aggregation)
- `phantom-paths` (path resolution via three regex patterns + `existsSync()`)
- `density` (this module: symbol findability in AGENTS.md from .sum metadata, disabled)
