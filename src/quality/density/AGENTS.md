# quality/density

Findability validation module that checks whether exported symbols from .sum files appear in parent AGENTS.md content to ensure AI agents can locate key identifiers.

## Contents

### [validator.ts](./validator.ts)
Defines `validateFindability()` function and `FindabilityResult` interface; currently returns empty array pending re-implementation of structured symbol extraction.

## Implementation Status

**Currently Stubbed**: Module retained as placeholder following removal of `metadata.publicInterface` from sum file schema. Original implementation performed heuristic validation by extracting exported symbol names (functions, classes, types, constants) from .sum metadata and checking their presence in AGENTS.md text via string matching. Function signature preserved with `_agentsMdContent` and `_sumFiles` parameters underscore-prefixed to indicate unused state.

## Type Contracts

`FindabilityResult` captures per-file validation outcome:
- `filePath: string` — relative path to .sum file
- `symbolsTested: string[]` — exported identifiers checked for presence
- `symbolsFound: string[]` — symbols located in AGENTS.md content
- `symbolsMissing: string[]` — symbols absent from AGENTS.md
- `score: number` — findability ratio (0-1 scale, found/tested)

## Integration Points

Imports `SumFileContent` from `../../generation/writers/sum.js` to type the sumFiles parameter. Designed for pure string-based matching without LLM calls — future implementation requires post-processing pass to extract public interface symbols from SumFileContent text before performing presence checks against AGENTS.md content.

## Future Re-implementation

Requires structured metadata extraction mechanism to populate `symbolsTested` array. Candidate approaches: regex-based parsing of .sum file export sections, dedicated symbol extraction prompt pass, or TypeScript AST analysis for TypeScript files.
