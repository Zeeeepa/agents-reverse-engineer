Disabled findability validation stub that previously verified exported symbols from .sum files appeared in parent AGENTS.md content, retained for future structured metadata extraction support.

## Contents

**[validator.ts](./validator.ts)** — Exports `validateFindability()` returning empty array; previously extracted symbol names from `SumFileContent.metadata.publicInterface` and performed substring search in AGENTS.md content to compute per-file `FindabilityResult` with score calculation.

## Exported Interface

**FindabilityResult** — Validation result containing `filePath`, `symbolsTested[]`, `symbolsFound[]`, `symbolsMissing[]`, and `score` (0.0–1.0 ratio of found to tested symbols).

**validateFindability()** — `(agentsMdContent: string, sumFiles: Map<string, SumFileContent>) => FindabilityResult[]` — Returns empty array; signature preserved but implementation gutted after `SumFileContent.metadata.publicInterface` removal.

## Disabled Feature Context

validator.ts implements LLM-free validation using string-based symbol matching with no AI subprocess calls. Disabled in `../index.ts` quality validation pipeline when `publicInterface` field removed from `SumFileContent` schema in `../../generation/writers/sum.ts`. Previously detected when directory-level AGENTS.md aggregation failed to preserve critical symbol names from child .sum file summaries.

## Restoration Path

Re-implementation requires:
1. Adding structured export extraction to .sum file generation (Phase 1 of three-phase pipeline in `../../generation/orchestrator.ts`)
2. Parsing YAML frontmatter in .sum files via `readSumFile()` from `../../generation/writers/sum.ts`
3. Implementing symbol presence checks against AGENTS.md content
4. Re-enabling in `../index.ts` quality validator orchestrator

## Type Dependencies

Imports `SumFileContent` from `../../generation/writers/sum.ts` — Interface for parsed .sum file containing YAML frontmatter (`generated_at`, `content_hash`, `purpose`, `critical_todos[]`, `related_files[]`) and markdown summary content.
