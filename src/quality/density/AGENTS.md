# src/quality/density

Validates that exported symbols from .sum files appear in parent AGENTS.md files, ensuring AI assistants can locate key identifiers from directory-level documentation. Module currently disabled pending structured metadata support.

## Contents

### Validation Interface

**[validator.ts](./validator.ts)** — Exports `FindabilityResult` interface (filePath, symbolsTested, symbolsFound, symbolsMissing, score) and `validateFindability()` stub function. Returns empty array because publicInterface extraction was removed from SumFileContent schema. Imports `SumFileContent` from `../../generation/writers/sum.js` for type compatibility. Function signature preserved for future re-implementation via string-based symbol matching or post-processing passes.

## Current State

`validateFindability()` disabled (returns `[]`) after structured metadata removal. Module retained as architectural placeholder for anchor term preservation enforcement when symbol extraction pipeline is restored.

## Relationship to Quality System

Invoked by parent `src/quality/index.ts` module alongside `src/quality/inconsistency/` and `src/quality/phantom-paths/` validators to produce comprehensive quality reports for generated documentation artifacts.
