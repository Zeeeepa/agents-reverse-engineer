# src/quality/density

Stub validation module for findability analysis (symbol presence in aggregated AGENTS.md), disabled after `SumFileContent.metadata.publicInterface` removal pending structured extraction re-implementation.

## Contents

**[validator.ts](./validator.ts)** — Exports `validateFindability(_agentsMdContent, _sumFiles)` returning empty `FindabilityResult[]` array; previously verified exported symbols from `.sum` files appeared in parent `AGENTS.md` via string matching, now disabled awaiting post-processing extraction support.

## Implementation Status

`validateFindability()` signature preserved for future re-implementation but returns `[]` unconditionally. Original logic performed heuristic substring search to detect whether key symbols from source file summaries appeared in aggregated directory documentation. Disabled when `SumFileContent` schema removed structured `publicInterface` field (see `src/generation/writers/sum.ts`). Module retained to support future LLM-based or AST-based symbol extraction passes.

## Type Surface

`FindabilityResult` interface with fields:
- `filePath: string` — validated `.sum` file path
- `symbolsTested: string[]` — symbols checked for presence
- `symbolsFound: string[]` — symbols located in AGENTS.md
- `symbolsMissing: string[]` — symbols absent from AGENTS.md
- `score: number` — ratio `symbolsFound.length / symbolsTested.length` (0-1 range)

## Dependencies

Imports `SumFileContent` type from `../../generation/writers/sum.js` for parameter type annotation. No runtime dependencies since function body returns empty array.
