# src/quality/density

Stub findability validation module, currently disabled after removal of structured `publicInterface` metadata from `.sum` file schema. Preserved for future re-implementation via post-processing symbol extraction.

## Contents

### [validator.ts](./validator.ts)
Exports `validateFindability()` stub returning empty `FindabilityResult[]` array and `FindabilityResult` interface defining validation outcome structure with `filePath`, `symbolsTested`, `symbolsFound`, `symbolsMissing`, `score` fields.

## Architecture

**Validation Approach (Disabled):** Originally performed string-based substring matching to verify exported symbols from `.sum` files appeared in parent `AGENTS.md` content without LLM calls. Logic removed when `SumFileContent.metadata.publicInterface` field was deleted from schema.

**Current State:** `validateFindability(_agentsMdContent: string, _sumFiles: Map<string, SumFileContent>)` unconditionally returns `[]` with parameters prefixed by underscores indicating unused status. Function signature retained for future structured extraction support via post-processing passes.

## Integration Points

Consumed by `src/quality/index.ts` which aggregates quality validators (`validateCodeDocConsistency`, `validateCodeCodeConsistency`, `validatePhantomPaths`, `validateFindability`). Produces no findings in current implementation but return type `FindabilityResult[]` preserved in reporting pipeline.

**Type Dependencies:**
- `SumFileContent` imported from `../../generation/writers/sum.js` (verified path)
- `FindabilityResult` consumed by quality reporting aggregator

## Behavioral Contracts

**Return Value:** Always `[]` (empty array) indicating zero validation findings.

**Score Calculation (Historical):** Ratio of `symbolsFound.length / symbolsTested.length` yielding `0.0` (no symbols) to `1.0` (all symbols present) when validation was active.
