# src/quality/density

Heuristic validation that exported symbols from child `.sum` files appear in parent `AGENTS.md` aggregations, using string-based matching with no LLM involvement.

## Contents

**[validator.ts](./validator.ts)** — Exports `validateFindability(agentsMdContent: string, sumFiles: Map<string, SumFileContent>): FindabilityResult[]` (currently returns empty array; awaits future structured metadata extraction) and `FindabilityResult` type (`filePath`, `symbolsTested`/`symbolsFound`/`symbolsMissing`, `score` ratio 0–1).

## Architecture

Unlike LLM-driven quality checks in `src/quality/inconsistency/` (`code-vs-doc.ts`, `code-vs-code.ts`), `validateFindability()` performs deterministic string searches: for each `.sum` file in the map, tests whether exported symbol names (from hypothetical future `publicInterface` frontmatter field) appear verbatim in the parent `AGENTS.md` content string. Returns `FindabilityResult[]` array with per-file scores (ratio of found to tested symbols).

## Current State

**Stub implementation**: returns `[]` because the pipeline no longer extracts structured `publicInterface` metadata from `.sum` YAML frontmatter. The function signature and `FindabilityResult` type remain as placeholders for future post-processing passes that would populate symbol lists via AST parsing or regex extraction, then invoke `validateFindability()` to verify aggregation completeness.

## Integration Points

Imports `SumFileContent` from `../../generation/writers/sum.js` to type the `.sum` file map parameter (maps file paths to parsed YAML frontmatter + markdown content). Intended to be called after `src/generation/orchestrator.ts` completes phase-2-dirs (directory `AGENTS.md` generation), consuming `AGENTS.md` content and the set of child `.sum` files to verify no critical identifiers were omitted during aggregation.
