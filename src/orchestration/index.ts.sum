**Barrel export module aggregating the public API of the orchestration subsystem (concurrency pool, progress tracking, command execution, tracing).**

## Exported Types

- **FileTaskResult**: Task outcome for file-level operations
- **RunSummary**: Aggregate metrics from command execution
- **ProgressEvent**: Event payload for progress reporting
- **CommandRunOptions**: Configuration object threaded through runner → pool → AIService
- **PoolOptions**: Concurrency pool configuration (worker count, iterator)
- **TaskResult**: Generic task outcome from `runPool<T>()`
- **ITraceWriter**: Interface for NDJSON trace event emission
- **TraceEvent**: Discriminated union of trace event types (phase:start/end, worker:start/end, task:pickup/done, subprocess:spawn/exit, retry)
- **TraceEventPayload**: Union of payload shapes for all TraceEvent variants

## Exported Functions

- **runPool**: Iterator-based concurrency pool executor (shared iterator, N workers, serialized via promise chain)
- **createTraceWriter**: Factory function returning ITraceWriter implementation (TraceWriter or NullTraceWriter based on enablement)
- **cleanupOldTraces**: Deletes trace files older than retention threshold from `.agents-reverse-engineer/traces/`

## Exported Classes

- **ProgressReporter**: Emits ProgressEvent objects during command execution (file completions, phase transitions)
- **ProgressLog**: Writes human-readable progress updates to `.agents-reverse-engineer/progress.log`
- **PlanTracker**: Serializes plan state writes to disk via promise chain (prevents corruption from concurrent workers)
- **CommandRunner**: Orchestrates three-phase execution (file analysis → directory AGENTS.md → root docs) with AIService integration

## Module Role

Single import point for orchestration engine. Consumers (CLI commands, test suites) import from `./orchestration/index.js` to access runPool, CommandRunner, ProgressReporter, PlanTracker, and tracing infrastructure without direct coupling to internal module structure (`./pool.js`, `./runner.js`, `./progress.js`, `./plan-tracker.js`, `./trace.js`, `./types.js`).
