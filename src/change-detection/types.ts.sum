**Defines TypeScript interfaces and types for git-based change detection, representing file changes, change detection results, and configuration options.**

## Exported Types

**ChangeType** — Union type `'added' | 'modified' | 'deleted' | 'renamed'` representing possible git diff statuses for files.

**FileChange** — Interface with `path: string` (relative path, new path for renames), `status: ChangeType`, optional `oldPath?: string` (original path for renamed files). Represents individual file change detected from git diff.

**ChangeDetectionResult** — Interface aggregating `currentCommit: string`, `baseCommit: string`, `changes: FileChange[]`, `includesUncommitted: boolean`. Returned by change detection operations to describe what changed between commits.

**ChangeDetectionOptions** — Configuration interface with optional `includeUncommitted?: boolean` flag controlling whether staged and working directory changes merge into detection results.

## Integration Context

Used by `src/change-detection/detector.ts` which implements git diff parsing via `simple-git` library. Supports `git diff --name-status -M` with rename detection (50% similarity threshold). The `FileChange.oldPath` field populated when `ChangeType` is `'renamed'`. Consumed by `src/update/orchestrator.ts` for incremental documentation updates via SHA-256 hash comparison against `.sum` frontmatter `content_hash` fields.
