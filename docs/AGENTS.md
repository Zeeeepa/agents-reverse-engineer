# docs

Contains the original vision document (INPUT.md) defining the Recursive Language Model (RLM) algorithm, brownfield documentation methodology, and core feature requirements that guide agents-reverse-engineer development.

## Contents

**[INPUT.md](./INPUT.md)** — Original project specification defining RLM bottom-up recursive execution pattern (leaf-to-root file analysis → directory aggregation → root synthesis), intended integration partners (SpecKit, BMAD, Get Shit Done), session hook requirements, and CLI command surface (`/are-generate`, `/are-update`).

## Role in Project

INPUT.md serves as the canonical requirements document referenced during feature development and architectural decisions. The RLM algorithm described therein drives the three-phase generation pipeline implemented in `src/generation/orchestrator.ts` and `src/orchestration/runner.ts`. Integration partner analysis (GSD, BMAD methodologies) informed the directory-level documentation patterns (`AGENTS.md`, optional architecture sections) and command execution via Claude Code/OpenCode/Gemini backends defined in `src/ai/backends/`.
