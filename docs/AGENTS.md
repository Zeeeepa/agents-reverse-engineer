# docs

Project requirements and design vision for Agents Reverse Engineer (ARE). INPUT.md defines the brownfield documentation automation tool, specifies the Recursive Language Model (RLM) execution strategy, and outlines integration targets with Claude Code, OpenCode, SpecKit, BMAD, and Get Shit Done (GSD).

## Contents

- **[INPUT.md](./INPUT.md)**: Original project specification defining ARE's scope, RLM workflow (leaf-first traversal, `.sum` generation, AGENTS.md aggregation), command interface (`/are-generate`, `/are-update`), auxiliary file taxonomy (ARCHITECTURE.md, STRUCTURE.md, STACK.md, INTEGRATIONS.md, INFRASTRUCTURE.md, CONVENTIONS.md, TESTING.md, PATTERNS.md, CONCERNS.md), and research directives for GSD/BMAD codebase analysis.

## Role in Project Architecture

INPUT.md serves as the canonical requirements document referenced during development and reconstruction. The RLM algorithm specified here is implemented in [`../src/generation/orchestrator.ts`](../src/generation/orchestrator.ts) (post-order traversal) and [`../src/generation/executor.ts`](../src/generation/executor.ts) (file analysis, AGENTS.md generation). Session-end hook integration directives correspond to implementations in [`../hooks/`](../hooks/) (are-session-end.js, opencode-are-session-end.js). Command interface definitions map to CLI commands in [`../src/cli/generate.ts`](../src/cli/generate.ts) and [`../src/cli/update.ts`](../src/cli/update.ts).

## Integration Targets

INPUT.md specifies compatibility with:
- **Claude Code**: Primary agent tool, references hooks/are-session-end.js
- **OpenCode**: Alternative agent tool, references hooks/opencode-are-session-end.js
- **SpecKit**: GitHub spec generation tool (https://github.com/github/spec-kit)
- **BMAD**: Brownfield methodology (https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD)
- **GSD**: Get Shit Done workflow (https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done)

Research directives instruct adoption of GSD repository structure patterns and BMAD brownfield project analysis techniques.
