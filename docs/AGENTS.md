# docs

Founding requirements and vision documentation for agents-reverse-engineer, defining the RLM (Recursive Language Model) algorithm, command interface contracts, and brownfield reverse engineering workflow specifications.

## Contents

### [INPUT.md](./INPUT.md)
Original project inception document specifying the RLM leaf-first traversal algorithm, `{filename}.sum` → AGENTS.md synthesis pipeline, `/are-generate` and `/are-update` command semantics, and companion tool ecosystem (SpecKit, BMAD, GSD).

## Behavioral Contracts

### RLM Algorithm
Recursive Language Model workflow: discovers project structure tree, executes leaf-first traversal, generates `{filename}.sum` summaries for files, synthesizes directory-level AGENTS.md post-order after all child summaries complete, recurses backward to project root. Each AGENTS.md describes current directory and sub-structure, may reference ARCHITECTURE.md, STRUCTURE.md, STACK.md, INTEGRATIONS.md, INFRASTRUCTURE.md, CONVENTIONS.md, TESTING.md, PATTERNS.md, CONCERNS.md.

### Command Interface
- `/are-generate`: initiates full documentation generation across entire codebase
- `/are-update`: performs incremental updates for changed files only
- Session-end hooks: trigger automatic update of impacted files on Claude Code/OpenCode session termination
