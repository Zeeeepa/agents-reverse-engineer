# docs

Original vision document for agents-reverse-engineer (ARE), defining the brownfield documentation automation tool architecture and recursive language model execution strategy.

## Contents

### Vision Document

**[INPUT.md](./INPUT.md)** — Requirements and vision document defining the Recursive Language Model (RLM) algorithm: builds project structure tree, executes at leaf nodes to generate `{filename}.sum` summaries, then recursively generates AGENTS.md from leaf to root using post-order traversal.

## Purpose

INPUT.md predates implementation and describes the conceptual design for the ARE CLI tool, including:
- Generated artifact types: AGENTS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, STRUCTURE.md, STACK.md, INTEGRATIONS.md, INFRASTRUCTURE.md, CONVENTIONS.md, TESTING.md, PATTERNS.md, CONCERNS.md, CLAUDE.md
- Primary commands: `/are-generate`, `/are-update`
- Integration targets: Claude Code, OpenCode, LLM agent tools
- Complementary tools: SpecKit, BMAD, Get Shit Done (GSD)
- Session hooks: `are-session-end.js`, `opencode-are-session-end.js` (located in `../hooks/`)
- Architectural inspiration from GSD methodology and BMAD brownfield patterns

## Relationship to Implementation

INPUT.md serves as the original requirements specification. Implemented workflow phases are defined in `../src/generation/executor.ts` (file analysis, directory AGENTS.md generation, root documentation), with the RLM algorithm orchestrated by `../src/generation/orchestrator.ts` using post-order tree traversal via `../src/discovery/walker.ts`.
