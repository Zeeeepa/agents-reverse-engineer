# docs

Original design specification and research artifacts defining the Recursive Language Model (RLM) algorithm and agents-reverse-engineer tool inception rationale.

## Contents

### [INPUT.md](./INPUT.md)
Inception document defining the RLM algorithm via post-order tree traversal (leaf file analysis → directory aggregation → root synthesis), proposed command interface (`/are-generate`, `/are-update`), session lifecycle integration requirements, and research directives for GSD/BMAD methodology analysis.

## Purpose

`INPUT.md` serves as the foundational design specification established before implementation began. It defines the core RLM workflow: (1) build project tree, (2) traverse post-order starting at deepest leaves, (3) generate `.sum` summaries for files, (4) generate `AGENTS.md` for directories once all children complete, (5) recurse upward to project root. The document specifies target AI platforms (Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini) and automatic documentation synchronization via session-end hooks.

## Relationship to Implementation

The three-phase pipeline in `src/generation/orchestrator.ts` implements the RLM algorithm specified here:
- **Phase 1** (concurrent file analysis) → `.sum` generation for leaf nodes
- **Phase 2** (post-order directory aggregation) → `AGENTS.md` synthesis with depth-based sorting
- **Phase 3** (root synthesis) → `CLAUDE.md`/`GEMINI.md`/`OPENCODE.md` platform-specific integration documents

Session lifecycle hooks in `hooks/are-session-end.js` and `hooks/opencode-are-session-end.js` implement the automatic update mechanism proposed in this specification.
