# docs

**Original vision document defining the Recursive Language Model (RLM) algorithm for agents-reverse-engineer, establishing post-order traversal methodology, directory documentation schema, multi-platform requirements, and integration references.**

## Contents

### [INPUT.md](./INPUT.md)
Defines RLM algorithm executing post-order traversal: build project tree, analyze leaf files to generate `{filename}.sum` summaries, synthesize directory `AGENTS.md` when all children complete, recurse to root producing `CLAUDE.md` and platform-specific docs.

## Recursive Language Model Algorithm

**Core traversal strategy:**
1. Build complete project structure tree via directory walk
2. Execute at first leaf node (file level)
3. Generate `{filename}.sum` per file via AI analysis
4. When directory leaves complete, synthesize `AGENTS.md` consuming child `.sum` files
5. Recurse backward to root producing final integration docs

**Guarantees:** Child summaries exist before parent directory analysis, enabling bottom-up synthesis where directory docs reference already-generated file summaries and subdirectory `AGENTS.md` files.

## Directory Documentation Schema

INPUT.md defines nine supplementary document types referenceable from `AGENTS.md`:

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — system design and component relationships
- `STRUCTURE.md` — directory organization rationale
- `STACK.md` — technology stack and dependencies
- `INTEGRATIONS.md` — external service integrations
- `INFRASTRUCTURE.md` — deployment and runtime configuration
- `CONVENTIONS.md` — coding standards and naming patterns
- `TESTING.md` — test strategy and frameworks
- `PATTERNS.md` — design patterns and architectural idioms
- `CONCERNS.md` — known issues and technical debt

## Multi-Platform Requirements

**Target runtimes:** Claude Code, OpenCode, and alternative LLM agent tools requiring brownfield project context.

**Core features:**
- Command execution using RLM with Claude Code or alternative backends
- Session-end hook for incremental updates of impacted files
- `AGENTS.md` generation in every project directory
- Platform-agnostic documentation format

**Usage commands:**
```bash
/are-generate  # Full documentation generation via RLM
/are-update    # Incremental update of changed files
```
