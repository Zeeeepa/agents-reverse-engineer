INPUT.md defines the original vision, feature requirements, and Recursive Language Model (RLM) algorithm specification for agents-reverse-engineer—the foundational design document that establishes the three-phase brownfield documentation strategy (file-level `.sum` generation, directory-level `AGENTS.md` synthesis, root document convergence), CLI command contracts (`/are-generate`, `/are-update`), session lifecycle hook requirements, and integration references to complementary tools (SpecKit, BMAD, Get Shit Done).

## Contents

**[INPUT.md](./INPUT.md)** — Specifies RLM post-order traversal algorithm (leaf-to-root aggregation), command execution requirements via Claude Code or platform-specific alternatives, session-end auto-update hooks, multi-tier documentation system (`AGENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `STRUCTURE.md`, `STACK.md`, `INTEGRATIONS.md`, `INFRASTRUCTURE.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md`, `TESTING.md`, `PATTERNS.md`, `CONCERNS.md`), and references three inspirational projects for implementation context: SpecKit (GitHub's specification toolkit), BMAD (methodology framework), GSD (workflow system).

## Behavioral Contracts

**RLM Algorithm Execution Order:**
1. Build project structure tree via directory traversal
2. Execute analysis starting at first leaf node, proceeding recursively backward (post-order traversal)
3. File-level: Generate `{filename}.sum` for each source file leaf
4. Directory-level: When all leaves in directory are summarized, analyze directory and generate `AGENTS.md` plus additional documentation if needed
5. Root convergence: Continue recursive aggregation until project root is reached

**CLI Command Surface:**
- `/are-generate` — Full documentation generation from scratch
- `/are-update` — Incremental update of impacted files
