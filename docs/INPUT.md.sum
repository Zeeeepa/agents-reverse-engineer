**INPUT.md defines the original vision and requirements specification for the agents-reverse-engineer project, establishing the Recursive Language Model (RLM) algorithm for brownfield documentation generation via post-order traversal of project trees.**

## Vision Statement

The document establishes agents-reverse-engineer as a lightweight tool to reverse engineer brownfield projects and generate `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and platform-specific documentation compatible with Claude Code, OpenCode, and other agent tools. Born from the need to streamline brownfield project documentation, providing agents with clear codebase overviews for long-term maintenance.

## Recursive Language Model Algorithm

The RLM algorithm executes as follows:

1. Build complete project structure tree via directory traversal
2. Start execution at first leaf node (file level)
3. Analyze each file and generate `{filename}.sum` summary files
4. When all leaf files in a directory are summarized, analyze the directory and generate `AGENTS.md` plus supplementary files if needed
5. Continue recursively backward until reaching project root

This post-order traversal ensures child summaries exist before parent directory analysis, enabling bottom-up documentation synthesis where directory docs can reference already-generated file summaries and subdirectory `AGENTS.md` files.

## Directory Documentation Schema

Each `AGENTS.md` file describes current directory content and substructure. May reference supplementary documentation:

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — System design and component relationships
- `STRUCTURE.md` — Directory organization rationale
- `STACK.md` — Technology stack and dependencies
- `INTEGRATIONS.md` — External service integrations
- `INFRASTRUCTURE.md` — Deployment and runtime configuration
- `CONVENTIONS.md` — Coding standards and naming patterns
- `TESTING.md` — Test strategy and frameworks
- `PATTERNS.md` — Design patterns and architectural idioms
- `CONCERNS.md` — Known issues and technical debt

## Required Features

- Command execution using Recursive Language Model with Claude Code or alternative LLM agent tools (commands for Claude, available alternatives for others)
- Session-end hook for incremental updates of impacted files
- Generation of `AGENTS.md` in every project directory
- Multi-platform support: Claude Code, OpenCode, and other agent tools

## Usage Commands

```bash
/are-generate  # Full documentation generation via RLM
/are-update    # Incremental update of changed files
```

## Research References

Document references two methodologies for analysis:

- **GSD (Get Shit Done)**: https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done
- **BMAD**: https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD

Recommends analyzing repository structure (primarily GSD, partially BMAD), brownfield project approaches, special commands, and codebase implementation details.

## Complementary Tooling

Designed for workflow integration with:

- **SpecKit**: https://github.com/github/spec-kit
