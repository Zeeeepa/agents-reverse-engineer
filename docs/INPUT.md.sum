**INPUT.md documents the original vision, RLM algorithm, and feature requirements for agents-reverse-engineer brownfield documentation tool.**

## Vision & Motivation

Defines ARE as "light-weight and powerful tool to reverse engineer a brownfield project" generating AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md documentation compatible with Claude Code, OpenCode, and other agent tools. Created to streamline documenting existing projects and provide agents clear codebase overviews for maintenance.

## Intended Integration Partners

Lists three complementary tools:
- SpecKit (https://github.com/github/spec-kit) for project specifications
- BMAD (https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD) for brownfield documentation methodology  
- Get Shit Done (https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done) for milestone-driven workflow

## Core Feature Requirements

**Command Execution:** Should provide command executing scripts via Recursive Language Model (RLM) using Claude Code or alternative LLM agent tools, with platform-specific invocation (command for Claude, alternatives for others).

**Session Hooks:** Should support session-end hooks for updating impacted files automatically.

**Directory Documentation:** Should generate AGENTS.md file in every directory describing current directory and sub-structure content, with optional references to ARCHITECTURE.md, STRUCTURE.md, STACK.md, INTEGRATIONS.md, INFRASTRUCTURE.md, CONVENTIONS.md, TESTING.md, PATTERNS.md, CONCERNS.md.

## RLM Algorithm Specification

Defines bottom-up recursive execution pattern:
1. Build project structure tree
2. Start execution at first leaf, build recursively backward
3. At file leaf: analyze file, generate `{filename}.sum` summary
4. When all directory leaves summarized: analyze directory, generate AGENTS.md (plus other files if needed)
5. Continue recursively until project root reached

## Research Directive

Instructs detailed analysis of GSD and BMAD methodologies, examining repository structure (primarily GSD, partially BMAD), brownfield project approach, special commands, implementation details, and codebase inspection.

## Usage Commands

Specifies two CLI commands:
- `/are-generate` for full documentation generation
- `/are-update` for incremental updates
