**INPUT.md documents the original project vision and Recursive Language Model (RLM) algorithm specification that defines agents-reverse-engineer's three-phase brownfield documentation strategy.**

## Vision Statement

Describes agents-reverse-engineer as a lightweight tool for generating `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and platform-specific documentation from brownfield codebases. Compatible with Claude Code, OpenCode, and other agent tools. Created to provide agents with clear codebase overviews for long-term maintenance.

## Inspirational Projects

References three complementary tools for integration context:
- **SpecKit**: https://github.com/github/spec-kit — GitHub's specification toolkit
- **BMAD**: https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD — BMAD methodology framework
- **Get Shit Done (GSD)**: https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done — GSD workflow system

Instructs detailed analysis of GSD and BMAD approaches to brownfield projects, repository structure patterns, special commands, and implementation details via codebase inspection.

## Feature Requirements

**Command execution:**
- Implement RLM algorithm via Claude Code commands or platform-specific alternatives for other LLM agent tools

**Session lifecycle:**
- Hook mechanism on session end to update impacted files automatically

**Directory documentation:**
- Generate `AGENTS.md` in every project directory describing current directory content and substructure
- Support references to specialized documentation: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `STRUCTURE.md`, `STACK.md`, `INTEGRATIONS.md`, `INFRASTRUCTURE.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md`, `TESTING.md`, `PATTERNS.md`, `CONCERNS.md`

## RLM Algorithm Specification

**Execution flow:**
1. Build project structure tree via directory traversal
2. Execute analysis starting at first leaf node, proceeding recursively backward (post-order traversal)
3. **File-level analysis**: Generate `{filename}.sum` summary file for each source file leaf
4. **Directory-level synthesis**: When all leaves in directory are summarized, analyze directory and generate `AGENTS.md` plus additional referenced documentation files if needed
5. **Root convergence**: Continue recursive aggregation until project root is reached

## CLI Commands

Defines two primary user-facing commands:
- `/are-generate` — Full documentation generation from scratch
- `/are-update` — Incremental update of impacted files
