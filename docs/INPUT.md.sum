**INPUT.md documents the original design vision and inception rationale for the agents-reverse-engineer tool, defining the Recursive Language Model (RLM) algorithm for brownfield project documentation generation through post-order tree traversal of file summaries and directory aggregation.**

## Original Vision

Created to streamline brownfield project documentation by providing AI agents with clear codebase overviews. Designed for compatibility with Claude Code, OpenCode, and other agent tools, complementing SpecKit (https://github.com/github/spec-kit), BMAD (https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD), and Get Shit Done (https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done).

## RLM Algorithm Definition

The Recursive Language Model workflow executes as:
1. Build project structure tree via directory traversal
2. Start execution at first leaf (deepest file node) and build recursively backward toward root
3. For leaf files: analyze content and generate `{filename}.sum` summary artifact
4. For directories: once all child leaf summaries exist, analyze directory contents and generate `AGENTS.md` (plus optional `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `STRUCTURE.md`, `STACK.md`, `INTEGRATIONS.md`, `INFRASTRUCTURE.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md`, `TESTING.md`, `PATTERNS.md`, `CONCERNS.md`)
5. Continue post-order traversal recursively until project root reached

## Command Interface

Proposed command patterns:
- `/are-generate` — Full documentation generation via RLM execution
- `/are-update` — Incremental regeneration for modified files

## Research Directives

Document instructed detailed analysis of GSD (Get Shit Done) and BMAD methodologies, specifically:
- Repository structure patterns (primarily GSD-inspired with BMAD elements)
- Brownfield project approach strategies
- Special command implementations and execution details
- Codebase architecture analysis requirements

## Session Lifecycle Integration

Original design specified session-end hook capability to automatically update impacted documentation files when agent sessions terminate, ensuring documentation remains synchronized with codebase changes without manual intervention.
