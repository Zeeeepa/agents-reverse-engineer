# .
The root directory (`.`) of the `agents-reverse-engineer` project contains the primary project metadata, documentation, configuration, and entry points for the CLI tool, which converts codebases into AI-friendly documentation formats like `.sum` files and `AGENTS.md` overviews for AI coding assistants.

## Stack
The `agents-reverse-engineer` project is a Node.js (`>=18.0.0`) application, written in TypeScript, using `tsc` for compilation to `dist/cli/index.js`. It exposes `agents-reverse-engineer` and `are` as CLI binaries.

## Configuration
The project's configuration is managed through `.agents-reverse-engineer/config.yaml` (described in `README.md`), defining `exclude.patterns`, `exclude.vendorDirs`, `exclude.binaryExtensions`, `options` for `followSymlinks` and `maxFileSize`, `output` settings, and `ai` settings including `backend`, `model`, `timeoutMs`, `maxRetries`, `concurrency`, and `telemetry.keepRuns`. TypeScript compilation is configured via `tsconfig.json`, setting `target` to `ES2022`, `module`/`moduleResolution` to `NodeNext`, and enabling `strict`, `esModuleInterop`, `declaration`, `declarationMap`, `sourceMap`.

## Workflow & Conventions
The project mandates Node.js 18+ and compatibility with an AI Coding Assistant (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, or `AGENTS.md` compatible). Development setup involves `git clone`, `npm install`, `npm run build` (or `npm run dev` for live reload). Changes are contributed via forked repositories, `main` branch, passing `npm run build`, and submitting a `pull request`. The `agents-reverse-engineer @latest` command provides an interactive installer (`are`, `are install`). Key CLI commands include `/are-init` (creates `.agents-reverse-engineer/config.yaml`), `/are-discover` (scans codebase, generates `GENERATION-PLAN.md`), `/are-generate` (executes plan, creates `.sum` files and `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` pointers), `/are-update` (regenerates docs for changed files), `/are-specify` (synthesizes `AGENTS.md` into `specs/SPEC.md`), `/are-rebuild` (reconstructs projects from specs), and `/are-clean` (removes generated docs). `npm run prepublishOnly` triggers `npm run build` and `npm run build:hooks`.
