# .vscode

VSCode workspace configuration for the agents-reverse-engineer project. Defines file explorer filtering and title bar theming to improve developer experience when working with AI-generated documentation artifacts.

## Contents

### Configuration Files

- [**settings.json**](./settings.json): Workspace-specific VSCode settings. Excludes `**/*.sum` files from the file explorer via `files.exclude` to hide AI-generated summaries produced by `SumWriter` (`src/generation/writers/sum.ts`). Applies green color scheme to title bar via `workbench.colorCustomizations`: `#19ad25` (active background), `#ffffff` (active foreground), `#287417` (inactive background), `#ffffffcc` (inactive foreground).

## Integration Context

The `.sum` exclusion pattern targets file-level summaries generated during the `are-generate` phase. Directory-level `AGENTS.md` files remain visible, as they serve as navigational indexes intended for manual review. This configuration applies only to the workspace scope and does not affect other IDE settings or file system visibility outside VSCode.
