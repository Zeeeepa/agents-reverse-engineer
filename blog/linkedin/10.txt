10 Tips for Getting the Best Documentation from ARE

You've installed agents-reverse-engineer (ARE) and run generate, but the output disappoints. The difference between mediocre and exceptional documentation comes down to how you use the tool. Here are 10 practical tips.

1. STRUCTURE CODE FOR BETTER SUMMARIES

Single-responsibility files produce better .sum files than kitchen-sink modules. When a file does five things, summaries become vague. Split code into focused files like jwt-token-validator.ts, password-hasher.ts, and date-formatter.ts instead of one utils.ts. That's also good software design.

2. USE MEANINGFUL NAMES

ARE's AI reads your function, class, and file names to understand code. A file named utils.ts produces generic summaries because the name conveys nothing. Name it jwt-token-validator.ts and the AI has context before reading code. Same for exports: export function process(data) tells the AI nothing, while export function validateUserRegistration(userData) tells it everything.

3. EXCLUDE THE NOISE

Don't let ARE analyze everything. Test fixtures, generated code, migrations, and vendored dependencies create noise. Add patterns to .agents-reverse-engineer/config.yaml. Less noise equals better signal.

4. CHOOSE THE RIGHT MODEL

ARE supports multiple AI models. Use sonnet (default) for most codebases. Use haiku for large projects needing speed. Use opus for complex, critical code. Specify with --model haiku or in config.yaml.

5. REVIEW AND EDIT .SUM FILES

Generated .sum files are starting points. If ARE misses the point, edit manually. ARE won't overwrite edits unless source files change or you use --force.

6. LEVERAGE AGENTS.LOCAL.MD

Put custom instructions in AGENTS.local.md at any directory level. ARE preserves it by injecting an @AGENTS.local.md directive, merging your guidance with generated documentation.

7. TUNE COMPRESSION FOR LARGE FILES

ARE automatically compresses documentation for large files. If summaries feel sparse, adjust compression settings in config.yaml.

8. RUN QUALITY CHECKS

Review ARE's quality reports. Code-vs-doc checks find undocumented exports. Code-vs-code checks find duplicate symbols. Phantom-path validation catches broken links.

9. USE --TRACE FOR LARGE PROJECTS

When things feel slow, use --trace to write detailed logs to .agents-reverse-engineer/traces/. Identify bottlenecks and debug failures.

10. ITERATE, DON'T PERFECTIONIST

The first run won't be perfect. Run ARE, review output, adjust exclusions and config, then regenerate. After 2-3 iterations, you'll have genuinely useful documentation.
