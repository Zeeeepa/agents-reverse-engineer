Rebuilding from Specs: ARE's Code Reconstruction Pipeline

Documentation tools typically work one way: code to docs. agents-reverse-engineer goes further — are rebuild takes project specifications and reconstructs source code, completing the full circle.

WHEN WOULD YOU USE THIS?

Scaffolding from specifications. Document an architecture, then use are rebuild to generate a working starting point. Useful for exploring multiple implementation approaches.

Framework migration. Modify your specification for a new framework and use are rebuild to generate migration scaffolding. The spec becomes the invariant; implementation becomes the variable.

Disaster recovery. Lost source code but retained specifications? are rebuild reconstructs a working implementation.

Exploring alternatives. What would your microservices look like as a monolith? Modify specs, run are rebuild, and explore architectural alternatives without manual rewriting.

HOW IT WORKS

Discovery and Parsing
readSpecFiles() discovers markdown files in specs/. Then partitionSpec() extracts Build Plan phases using regex to find headings defining sequential build phases.

Checkpoint Validation
Before generation, CheckpointManager.load() checks .rebuild-checkpoint tracking completed phases and SHA-256 hashes of specification files.

Orchestrated Execution
executeRebuild() groups rebuild units by order, creating sequential groups. Within groups, tasks run concurrently using runPool().

THE REBUILD PROMPT

buildRebuildPrompt() includes your project's Architecture section from AGENTS.md, extracts relevant subsections, and accumulates a builtContext buffer capped at 100KB for later phases to reference earlier output.

OUTPUT PARSING

AI-generated code uses strict delimiter format:

===FILE: src/models/user.ts===
export interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
}
===END_FILE===

If delimiters aren't found, ARE falls back to fenced code block parsing.

LIMITATIONS

AI-generated code requires review — treat output as scaffolding, not production code. Specification quality is critical. The 100KB context cap means large projects lose visibility into earlier files.
