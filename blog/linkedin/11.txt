Quality Gates and Debugging: ARE's Built-in Validation System

Generated documentation is only valuable if it's accurate. An AGENTS.md that references non-existent functions or misses critical exports creates more problems than it solves. That's why agents-reverse-engineer includes multi-layered validation.

THE FIVE EXECUTION PHASES

  1. pre-phase-1-cache: Reads existing .sum files for baseline
  2. phase-1-files: Parallel AI calls generating .sum files
  3. post-phase-1-quality: Validation on file-level documentation
  4. phase-2-dirs: Post-order aggregation building AGENTS.md
  5. post-phase-2: Validation on aggregated documentation

Quality checks run after each major phase, catching issues before they propagate.

POST-PHASE-1: CODE-VS-DOC CHECKS

checkCodeVsDoc() ensures every exported symbol appears in the corresponding .sum file. Undocumented exports mean AI assistants won't know about those capabilities.

checkCodeVsCode() catches duplicate symbols across files. While TypeScript's module system prevents runtime conflicts, naming collisions confuse AI assistants.

POST-PHASE-2: PHANTOM PATH VALIDATION

After directory aggregation, phantom path detection ensures every path referenced in AGENTS.md actually exists. The validator scans markdown links, backtick paths, and prose references, using dual-resolution (relative to file and project root) with .js to .ts substitution.

READING THE QUALITY REPORT

Findings are categorized: ERROR for critical problems like phantom paths, WARN for issues like undocumented exports, INFO for informational findings.

THE --DEBUG AND --TRACE FLAGS

The --debug flag reveals backend selection, configuration, prompts sent to the AI, and response metadata:

npx agents-reverse-engineer generate --debug

For deeper investigation, --trace writes NDJSON event logs capturing subprocess spawns, exits, retries, and task completions:

npx agents-reverse-engineer generate --trace

RUN LOGS

After each generation, ARE writes logs to .agents-reverse-engineer/logs/ with prompts, responses, tokens, cache stats, and latency. The 50 most recent logs are retained. ARE retries only rate limit errors with exponential backoff — timeouts are NOT retried.

TROUBLESHOOTING

All tasks failed? Check if the AI CLI is installed. Timeouts? Increase ai.timeoutMs or split large files. Rate limits? Reduce concurrency. Empty .sum files? Check --debug output.
