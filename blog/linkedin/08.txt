From Docs to Specs: Using are-specify to Generate Project Specifications

After running are generate, your codebase has documentation distributed across .sum files and AGENTS.md directories. But understanding the full architecture requires stitching together dozens of files. What if you need a single document for onboarding or project handoffs?

That's what are specify does — it synthesizes distributed documentation into unified project specifications.

WHAT IS ARE-SPECIFY?

The specify command reads all AGENTS.md files and synthesizes them into a comprehensive specification at specs/SPEC.md. Instead of navigating individual directory summaries, you get a bird's-eye view.

Unlike bottom-up AGENTS.md files, SPEC.md is centralized and top-down. The AI analyzes component relationships, identifies architectural patterns, extracts API surfaces, and organizes everything into a coherent narrative.

RUNNING THE COMMAND

npx agents-reverse-engineer specify

ARE discovers all AGENTS.md files, sends aggregated documentation to your AI backend, generates a structured specification, and writes it to specs/SPEC.md.

THE 12-SECTION STRUCTURE

The spec covers: Project Overview, Architecture, Components/Modules, Data Flow, API Surface, Dependencies, Configuration, Deployment, Testing Strategy, Security Considerations, Performance Characteristics, and Extension Points.

MULTI-FILE MODE

For large projects, --multi-file splits the spec into separate files from specs/01-overview.md through specs/12-extensions.md, enabling granular version control.

DRY RUN

Preview what will be processed before consuming API credits with --dry-run. This discovers files, calculates input size, shows planned sections, and exits without calling the AI.

USE CASES

Developer Onboarding — New team members understand architecture before diving into code.

Architecture Reviews — Shared artifact for design discussions and decision records.

Project Handoffs — Preserve institutional knowledge when transitioning between teams.

AI Context — Feed to ChatGPT, Copilot, or other AI tools that don't support AGENTS.md natively.

TIPS FOR BETTER SPECS

Run quality checks first. Ensure critical components aren't excluded. Review and edit the generated spec. Regenerate regularly as your codebase evolves. Commit specs to version control.
