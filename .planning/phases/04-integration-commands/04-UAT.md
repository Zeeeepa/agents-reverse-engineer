## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Init with Integration Flag
expected: Running `npx agents-reverse init --integration` detects Claude Code and creates command files in .claude/commands/ar/ plus hook file, reporting results
result: issue
reported: "When config already exists, --integration flag is ignored. Early return at line 59 skips integration code."
severity: major

### 2. Claude Code /ar:generate Command
expected: Invoking /ar:generate in Claude Code runs full documentation generation (creates .sum files and AGENTS.md hierarchy)
result: pass

### 3. Claude Code /ar:update Command
expected: Invoking /ar:update in Claude Code runs incremental update, only processing files changed since last run
result: pass

### 4. Claude Code /ar:init Command
expected: Invoking /ar:init in Claude Code runs initialization (creates config file if missing)
result: pass

### 5. npx agents-reverse CLI
expected: Running `npx agents-reverse generate` works correctly without collision with system `ar` archiver command
result: pass

### 6. SessionEnd Hook Registration
expected: File .claude/settings.json contains SessionEnd hook configuration pointing to .claude/hooks/ar-session-end.js
result: pass
