<objective>
Implement cross-file inconsistency detection, the structured report builder, and wire inconsistency detection into the generate/update command pipeline as a post-analysis pass.

Purpose: Completes the inconsistency detection feature (INCON-02, INCON-03) and integrates all quality checks into the existing command pipeline. After this plan, running `are generate` or `are update` will automatically check for inconsistencies and print a report if any are found.
Output: `src/quality/inconsistency/code-vs-code.ts`, `src/quality/inconsistency/reporter.ts`, `src/quality/index.ts`, updated `src/orchestration/runner.ts`, updated `src/orchestration/types.ts`, updated `src/cli/generate.ts`, updated `src/cli/update.ts`

  <name>Task 1: Code-vs-code detection and report builder (INCON-02, INCON-03)</name>

  <action>
    **Create `src/quality/inconsistency/code-vs-code.ts`:**

    Export `checkCodeVsCode(files: Array<{ path: string; content: string }>): CodeCodeInconsistency[]`.

    Implementation:
    1. Import `extractExports` from `./code-vs-doc.js` (Plan 01 output) and `CodeCodeInconsistency` from `../types.js`
    2. For each file, call `extractExports` to get export names
    3. Build a `Map<string, string[]>` of export name -> file paths
    4. For each export name that appears in more than one file, create a `CodeCodeInconsistency`:
       - `type: 'code-vs-code'`
       - `severity: 'warning'`
       - `files`: array of file paths that export this symbol
       - `description`: `Symbol "${name}" exported from ${count} files`
       - `pattern`: `'duplicate-export'`
    5. Return all detected inconsistencies

    This is a heuristic-only check (no AI calls). Scoped to the files passed in -- the caller groups by directory.

    **Create `src/quality/inconsistency/reporter.ts`:**

    Export two functions:

    1. `buildInconsistencyReport(issues: Inconsistency[], metadata: { projectRoot: string; filesChecked: number; durationMs: number }): InconsistencyReport`
       - Aggregates issues into the report structure from `types.ts`
       - Computes summary counts: total, codeVsDoc, codeVsCode, errors, warnings, info
       - Sets `metadata.timestamp` to `new Date().toISOString()`

    2. `formatReportForCli(report: InconsistencyReport): string`
       - Header: `=== Inconsistency Report ===`
       - Stats: `Checked {N} files in {M}ms`
       - Count: `Found {N} issue(s)`
       - Per issue: `[ERROR|WARN|INFO] {description}` followed by `  File: {path}` for code-vs-doc or `  Files: {paths}` for code-vs-code
       - Use plain text (no picocolors) -- keep the reporter pure so it can be tested easily. Color can be added by the CLI layer if needed.

    Import types from `../types.js`.

    **Create `src/quality/index.ts` (barrel):**

    Re-export from all submodules:
    - From `./types.js`: all types (`CodeDocInconsistency`, `CodeCodeInconsistency`, `Inconsistency`, `InconsistencyReport`, `InconsistencySeverity`)
    - From `./inconsistency/code-vs-doc.js`: `extractExports`, `checkCodeVsDoc`
    - From `./inconsistency/code-vs-code.js`: `checkCodeVsCode`
    - From `./inconsistency/reporter.js`: `buildInconsistencyReport`, `formatReportForCli`
    - From `./density/validator.js`: `validateFindability`, `FindabilityResult`
  </action>
  <verify>
    ```bash
    npx tsc --noEmit
    ```
    Confirm all exports resolve from `src/quality/index.ts`.
  </verify>
  <done>
    `checkCodeVsCode` detects duplicate exports across file groups. `buildInconsistencyReport` aggregates issues. `formatReportForCli` produces human-readable output. `src/quality/index.ts` barrel exports everything. `npx tsc --noEmit` passes.
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Wire inconsistency detection into generate/update pipeline</name>
  <files>src/orchestration/types.ts, src/orchestration/runner.ts, src/cli/generate.ts, src/cli/update.ts</files>
  <action>
    **Extend `RunSummary` in `src/orchestration/types.ts`:**

    Add three optional fields:
    ```typescript
    /** Number of code-vs-doc inconsistencies detected */
    inconsistenciesCodeVsDoc?: number;
    /** Number of code-vs-code inconsistencies detected */
    inconsistenciesCodeVsCode?: number;
    /** Full inconsistency report (undefined if no checks ran) */
    inconsistencyReport?: InconsistencyReport;
    ```
    Import `InconsistencyReport` from `../quality/index.js`.

    **Add post-analysis inconsistency pass in `CommandRunner.executeGenerate`:**

    After Phase 1 (file analysis) completes and before Phase 2 (directory docs), add an inconsistency detection pass:

    1. Import `readFile` (already imported), `readSumFile` and `SumFileContent` from writers/sum, `checkCodeVsDoc`, `checkCodeVsCode`, `buildInconsistencyReport`, `formatReportForCli` from quality barrel.
    2. Collect all successfully processed file paths from Phase 1 pool results.
    3. Group files by directory (using `path.dirname`).
    4. For each directory group:
       a. Read each source file content and its corresponding .sum file (the ones just generated)
       b. Run `checkCodeVsDoc(sourceContent, sumContent, filePath)` for each file -- NOTE: during `generate`, the .sum was just written by the current run, so code-vs-doc checks the freshly generated .sum against source. This is still useful because the LLM might miss exports.
       c. Collect all file objects `{ path, content }` and run `checkCodeVsCode(files)` on the directory group
    5. If any issues found, call `buildInconsistencyReport` and `formatReportForCli`, then print the report to stderr via `console.error`.
    6. Attach counts to the RunSummary.

    Keep this pass lightweight -- it only reads files already in memory or just written to disk. No AI calls.

    **For `CommandRunner.executeUpdate`:** Same inconsistency pass but only for the files that were re-analyzed (not all project files). Add after the pool results are collected.

    **In `src/cli/generate.ts` and `src/cli/update.ts`:** No changes needed -- the inconsistency report is handled inside `CommandRunner`. The commands already use `RunSummary` from the runner, which will now include inconsistency data.

    **Important implementation notes:**
    - The inconsistency pass must NOT throw -- wrap in try/catch. If it fails, log a warning and continue.
    - Use `console.error` for the report (stderr) to not interfere with JSON output.
    - Only print the report if `report.summary.total > 0`.
    - Do NOT modify the existing Phase 1, Phase 2, or Phase 3 logic in the runner. The inconsistency pass is a new step inserted between Phase 1 and Phase 2.
  </action>
  <verify>
    ```bash
    npx tsc --noEmit
    ```
    Confirm RunSummary has the new inconsistency fields.
    Confirm the inconsistency pass exists between Phase 1 and Phase 2 in `executeGenerate`.
    Confirm the inconsistency pass exists after pool results in `executeUpdate`.
  </verify>
  <done>
    RunSummary includes inconsistency counts. Both `executeGenerate` and `executeUpdate` run a post-analysis inconsistency detection pass. Report prints to stderr when issues found. Pass is non-throwing (try/catch wrapped). `npx tsc --noEmit` passes.
  </done>
