## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Key decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
v1.0 decisions archived in milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md.

v2.0 decisions:
- Tool drives LLM via CLI subprocess (full control over orchestration, telemetry, error handling)
- JSON log files for telemetry (human-readable, one file per run)
- runSubprocess always resolves -- callers decide how to handle errors via SubprocessResult fields
- AIServiceError uses string literal union codes for typed error branching
- DEFAULT_RETRY_OPTIONS omits isRetryable/onRetry since those are caller-specific
- isCommandOnPath exported from claude.ts for reuse by stub backends (avoids premature utility module)
- resolveBackend is the single entry point for all backend selection (auto and explicit)
- Rate-limit detection uses case-insensitive stderr substring matching (rate limit, 429, too many requests, overloaded)
- Telemetry records both successful and failed calls (error entries have zero tokens but actual latency)
- Config ai section uses nested .default({}) for full backward compatibility
- runPool returns sparse results array indexed by task position for easy correlation
- ProgressReporter ETA uses sliding window of 10 recent completions (not global average)
- executeUpdate runs only file analysis phase -- directory AGENTS.md regeneration is caller responsibility
- extractPurpose takes first non-header non-empty line from AI response, truncated to 120 chars
- Dry-run builds execution plan without backend resolution (works without AI CLI installed)
- Deprecated CLI flags (--execute, --stream) print notice to stderr to preserve JSON output on stdout
- Update command delegates to CommandRunner.executeUpdate (not inline pool logic)
- AGENTS.md regeneration after executeUpdate uses separate ProgressReporter for directory events
- Discover command returns normally (no process.exit(0)) for consistency and testability
- Prefix matching in lookupPricing sorts keys longest-first to avoid ambiguity between model ID prefixes
- Config pricing overrides spread over defaults before lookup so overrides always win
- formatTokens uses parseFloat to strip trailing zeros (1.0M becomes 1M)
- thinking field defaults to "not supported" until backends provide it
- filesRead attached post-call via setFilesReadOnLastEntry (caller knows context, not AIService)
- Root document tasks leave filesRead empty (aggregated content, no single source file)
- costAvailable is true if any entry has costSource !== "unavailable" (any-match semantics)
- pricingOverrides and costThresholdUsd optional on AIServiceOptions for backward compatibility
- costThresholdUsd on CommandRunOptions (display-layer concern) passed through to printSummary
- Unknown model warning uses console.error (stderr) and warnedModels Set for once-per-model dedup
- DEFAULT_MODEL_PRICING exported from AI barrel for consumer access to pricing table
- Line-anchored regex (^[ \t]*export) to skip commented-out exports without AST parsing
- missingFromCode uses partial match (iface.includes(exportName)) since publicInterface contains signatures
- Single-pass density prompt adaptation (not multi-pass Chain of Density) for cost efficiency
- Contents section links files without descriptions -- full description lives in .sum only
- Findability validator uses case-sensitive string.includes for symbol matching
- checkCodeVsCode operates on caller-scoped file groups to avoid cross-module false positives
- formatReportForCli uses plain text only (no picocolors) keeping the reporter pure and testable
- Inconsistency report prints to stderr to not interfere with JSON output on stdout
- Old .sum cache reads happen before Phase 1 pool processing to capture pre-overwrite state

v3.0 decisions:
- collectAgentsDocs returns Array<{ relativePath, content }> (pre-read content) so callers skip manual readFile loops
- SKIP_DIRS in collector.ts is module-private (not exported) to keep API surface minimal
- SPEC_SYSTEM_PROMPT enforces 9-section conceptual structure (not folder-mirroring or file path prescription)
- SpecExistsError thrown (not process.exit) so callers control error presentation
- Multi-file split on top-level '# ' headings with slugified filenames; pre-heading content to 00-preamble.md
- Atomic conflict detection in multi-file mode: all target files checked before any writes
- Extended timeout uses Math.max(config.ai.timeoutMs, 600_000) for 10min minimum on spec generation
- No language-specific metadata (readPackageSection removed) -- tool stays language-agnostic
- Debug output goes to stderr (console.error) to keep stdout clean for piping
- Auto-generate fallback: when no AGENTS.md found, invoke generateCommand() then re-collect (skipped in dry-run)

v4.0 decisions:
- Zod schema for checkpoint validation on disk load (consistent with config schema pattern)
- Build Plan phases as primary spec partition strategy; top-level headings as fallback
- Architecture + Public API Surface sections injected as context prefix in each rebuild unit
- Dual output format support: ===FILE:=== delimiters (primary) and fenced code blocks (fallback)
- CheckpointManager uses static factory methods (load/createFresh) instead of constructor overloading
- Spec drift detection checks both individual hash values and file count (added/removed files)

### Pending Todos

- **OpenCode plugin development**: Create `.opencode/plugin/` based hook for SessionEnd (deferred from v1.0, not in v2.0 scope)
- **Thinking content support**: Raise issue in AI assistant repository requesting thinking/reasoning content in `--output-format json` output. Infrastructure is ready in telemetry layer (TelemetryEntry.thinking field); just needs backend wiring when CLI adds support.

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 10 added (2026-02-09): Specify Command -- produce specification artifacts from AGENTS.md for project reconstruction
- Phase 11 added (2026-02-09): Rebuild Command -- reconstruct project from specs/ into rebuild/ with checkpoint-based multi-session progress tracking

### Blockers/Concerns
