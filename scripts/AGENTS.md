# scripts

Build automation utilities for pre-publish hook file preparation. Contains a single ES module script that copies hook source files from `hooks/` to `hooks/dist/` during the npm publish lifecycle, ensuring IDE integration hooks are bundled in the distributed package.

## Contents

**[build-hooks.js](./build-hooks.js)** — Copies `.js` hook files from `hooks/` to `hooks/dist/` via `copyFileSync()`, invoked by `npm run build:hooks` during `prepublishOnly` lifecycle.

## Build Integration

`build-hooks.js` executes after TypeScript compilation via `npm run prepublishOnly` script chain. Resolves `projectRoot` using `dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url))` for ES module compatibility. Creates output directory with `mkdirSync(recursive: true)` before copying files.

## File Selection

Filters source directory with predicate `f.endsWith('.js') && f !== 'dist'` to process `are-check-update.js`, `are-session-end.js`, `opencode-are-check-update.js`, `opencode-are-session-end.js` while preventing recursion into output directory.

## Output Consumption

Generated `hooks/dist/` directory consumed by `src/installer/operations.ts` during IDE command/hook installation for Claude Code, OpenCode, and Gemini CLI runtimes. Included in npm tarball via `package.json` files configuration.
