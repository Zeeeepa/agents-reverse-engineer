# scripts

Build automation directory containing Node.js scripts for npm lifecycle hooks and distribution preparation.

## Contents

- **[build-hooks.js](./build-hooks.js)**: Copies hook source files from `hooks/` to `hooks/dist/` during prepublish, filtering `.js` files via `readdirSync(HOOKS_SRC).filter(f => f.endsWith('.js') && f !== 'dist')`.

## Build Integration

Script invoked via `npm run build:hooks` and automatically triggered during `npm run prepublishOnly`. Creates `hooks/dist/` directory using `mkdirSync(HOOKS_DIST, { recursive: true })`, then copies each hook file using `copyFileSync(src, dest)`. Console output logs each file as `Copied: ${file} -> hooks/dist/${file}` and final count as `Done. ${hookFiles.length} hook(s) built.`.

## Path Resolution

Uses ESM path resolution pattern: `__filename` derived from `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)`, `__dirname` from `dirname(__filename)`, `projectRoot` resolved as `join(__dirname, '..')`. Hook paths: `HOOKS_SRC = join(projectRoot, 'hooks')`, `HOOKS_DIST = join(projectRoot, 'hooks', 'dist')`.
