Build automation utilities for preparing distribution artifacts during npm lifecycle.

## Contents

**[build-hooks.js](./build-hooks.js)** — Copies `hooks/*.js` session lifecycle hooks to `hooks/dist/` via `copyFileSync()` during `npm run build:hooks` or `prepublishOnly`. Creates destination directory with `mkdirSync({ recursive: true })`, excludes `dist/` subdirectory from source scan, logs each copied file to console.

## Workflow Integration

Invoked via:
- `npm run build:hooks` (manual execution)
- `npm run prepublishOnly` (automatic pre-publish hook)

Ensures `are-check-update.js`, `are-session-end.js`, `opencode-are-check-update.js`, `opencode-are-session-end.js` are bundled in published package for runtime hook registration by `src/installer/operations.ts` `installSessionHooks()`.

## Implementation Pattern

Synchronous file operations (`readdirSync()`, `copyFileSync()`) with explicit destination directory creation. No error handling — relies on Node.js throwing for missing source files or write permission failures. Logs `Copied {count} hooks to hooks/dist/` summary on completion.
