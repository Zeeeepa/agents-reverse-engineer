# scripts

Build automation scripts for pre-publish npm lifecycle hooks. Currently contains a single script that copies hook source files from `hooks/` to `hooks/dist/` for bundling in published packages.

## Contents

### Build Scripts

**[build-hooks.js](./build-hooks.js)** — Copies hook source files (`are-check-update.js`, `are-session-end.js`, `opencode-are-check-update.js`, `opencode-are-session-end.js`) from `hooks/` to `hooks/dist/` for npm bundling. Invoked via `npm run build:hooks` or automatically during `npm run prepublishOnly`. Uses ESM path resolution (`fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)`) and synchronous file operations (`mkdirSync`, `readdirSync`, `copyFileSync`).

## Execution Context

Scripts run in Node.js environment during npm lifecycle phases. `build-hooks.js` executes before package publication to ensure hook files are included in the tarball. No transformation applied—hooks remain executable JavaScript.

## Integration Points

- **npm lifecycle**: Triggered by `prepublishOnly` script in `package.json`
- **Hook system**: Copies source files to `hooks/dist/` for inclusion in published package
- **Dependencies**: Uses Node.js built-ins (`fs`, `path`, `url`) without external dependencies
