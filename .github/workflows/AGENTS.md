# .github/workflows

Workflow automation for npm package publishing triggered by GitHub release events.

## Contents

### [publish.yml](./publish.yml)
Defines GitHub Actions workflow that publishes agents-reverse-engineer to npm registry on `release:published` events or `workflow_dispatch` manual trigger, executing checkout → Node.js 20 setup → `npm ci` → `npm run build` → `npm publish --provenance --access public` with `NPM_TOKEN` authentication and signed provenance attestation.

## Integration with Release Flow

The workflow integrates with the `bump` skill (system-level) which handles:
1. Version increment in `package.json`
2. `CHANGELOG.md` generation
3. GitHub release creation with type `published`

After `bump` creates the GitHub release, `publish.yml` automatically triggers via the `release:published` event to publish the new version to npm registry. Manual publishing via `workflow_dispatch` bypasses the release trigger.

## Behavioral Contracts

### Trigger Events
- `release: types: [published]` — automatic trigger on GitHub release publication
- `workflow_dispatch` — manual execution from GitHub Actions UI

### Permissions
- `contents: read` — repository checkout access
- `id-token: write` — npm provenance attestation signing

### Environment Variables
- `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}` — npm registry authentication token
- Registry URL: `https://registry.npmjs.org`

### Build Artifacts
- Compiled output from `npm run build` (TypeScript → JavaScript via `tsc` per `../package.json` scripts)
- Published package with provenance metadata linking npm artifact to GitHub source commit
