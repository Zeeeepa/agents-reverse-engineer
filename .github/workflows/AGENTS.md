# .github/workflows

GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow definitions for the agents-reverse-engineer npm package. Currently contains a single workflow that automates npm publishing when releases are created or manually triggered.

## Contents

### Workflows

- [publish.yml](./publish.yml) — Publishes package to npm on release events, runs `npm ci && npm run build && npm publish --provenance --access public` on ubuntu-latest with Node.js 20

## Workflow Triggers

**publish.yml** activates on two event types:
- `release.published` — automatic execution when GitHub release is published
- `workflow_dispatch` — manual trigger from Actions UI

## Authentication & Secrets

The workflow requires `secrets.NPM_TOKEN` configured in repository settings. This token is exposed to the publish step as `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable, enabling authenticated npm registry access.

## Provenance

The `--provenance` flag generates SLSA build provenance attestations via GitHub's OIDC identity token (`id-token: write` permission). This links published npm artifacts to the GitHub Actions build that produced them.
