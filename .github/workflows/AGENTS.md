# .github/workflows

GitHub Actions workflow automation for the agents-reverse-engineer package. This directory contains CI/CD pipeline definitions that execute on repository events to automate package publication with cryptographic provenance.

## Contents

### Workflows

- **[publish.yml](./publish.yml)**: Publishes `agents-reverse-engineer` to npm registry with SLSA provenance attestation on release publication or manual dispatch.

## Workflow Triggers

`publish.yml` activates via two event paths:
- `release.types: [published]` — automatic execution when GitHub release transitions to published state
- `workflow_dispatch` — manual invocation from GitHub Actions UI

## Execution Pipeline

The `publish` job executes on `ubuntu-latest` with permission grants `contents: read` (repository access) and `id-token: write` (provenance signing):

1. `actions/checkout@v4` — retrieves repository source at commit SHA
2. `actions/setup-node@v4` — provisions Node.js 20 runtime with npm registry URL `https://registry.npmjs.org`
3. `npm ci` — installs locked dependencies from `package-lock.json`
4. `npm run build` — invokes TypeScript compiler via `tsc` to produce distributable artifacts
5. `npm publish --provenance --access public` — uploads package with cryptographically signed attestation linking tarball to source commit SHA, authenticated via `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN=${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}`

## Integration Dependencies

- **Repository secret**: `NPM_TOKEN` configured in GitHub repository settings provides npm registry authentication token
- **Package manifest**: `package.json` must define `build` script referencing `tsc` compilation step
- **TypeScript config**: `tsconfig.json` specifies output directory and module resolution for distributable build

## Provenance Attestation

The `--provenance` flag generates SLSA attestation bundle containing workflow run metadata, commit SHA, and OIDC-signed claims. This enables verifiable supply chain integrity for published npm packages, allowing consumers to cryptographically verify the package was built from declared source commits via GitHub-hosted runners.
