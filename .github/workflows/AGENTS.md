# .github/workflows

GitHub Actions CI/CD configuration for automated npm publishing of the agents-reverse-engineer package.

## Contents

### Workflow Files

**[publish.yml](./publish.yml)**: Defines the `publish` job triggered on release publication or manual dispatch, executing checkout → Node.js 20 setup → `npm ci` → `npm run build` (TypeScript compilation via `tsc`) → `npm publish` with provenance attestation.

## Workflow Architecture

**Trigger Modes**: The workflow activates on `release.types: [published]` events or via `workflow_dispatch` for manual execution. Authentication uses `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` from `secrets.NPM_TOKEN`.

**Build Pipeline**: Runs on `ubuntu-latest` with `contents: read` and `id-token: write` permissions (required for npm provenance). Steps invoke `actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/setup-node@v4` (registry URL `https://registry.npmjs.org`), `npm ci` (lockfile-based install), `npm run build` (compiles TypeScript from `src/cli/index.ts` via `tsconfig.json`), and `npm publish --provenance --access public`.

## Integration Points

**Build Dependencies**: Requires `package.json` to define the `build` script (executes `tsc`), `tsconfig.json` for compiler configuration, and entry point references to compiled artifacts. The workflow depends on the TypeScript build system documented in [../../src/cli/](../../src/cli/) and orchestration patterns from [../../src/orchestration/](../../src/orchestration/).

**Secrets Management**: NPM_TOKEN must be configured in GitHub repository settings under Secrets and variables → Actions. The token authenticates `npm publish` and is scoped to the `@agents-reverse-engineer` package namespace.
