# .github/workflows
The files in `.github/workflows` define continuous integration and deployment workflows for the project, automating tasks like publishing to GitHub Pages and npm.

## Contents
*   [pages.yml](./pages.yml): This workflow definition `pages.yml` configures the `Deploy Blog to GitHub Pages` workflow, triggered `on: push` (`main`, `site/**`, `blog/**`) or `workflow_dispatch`, requiring `contents: read`, `pages: write`, and `id-token: write` permissions.
*   [publish.yml](./publish.yml): This workflow definition `publish.yml` establishes the `Publish to npm` workflow, activated `on: release` (published) or `workflow_dispatch`, which performs an `npm publish` operation using `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`.

## Workflow & Conventions
This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows that dictate the project's automated continuous integration and deployment processes.
The `pages.yml` workflow orchestrates the deployment of the blog to GitHub Pages, utilizing `actions/checkout @v4`, `actions/setup-node @v4` for environment setup, `npm ci` for dependency installation, `node site/build.mjs` for site generation, `actions/upload-pages-artifact @v3` to upload the build output, and `actions/deploy-pages @v4` for the final deployment.
The `publish.yml` workflow manages the publication of packages to npm, executing an `npm publish` command within a `publish` job, authenticated via `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`.
